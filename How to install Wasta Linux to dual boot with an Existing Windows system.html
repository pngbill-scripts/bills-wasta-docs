<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Important Note: These instructions
tell how to </b><b>install</b><b> </b><b>Wasta Linux</b><b> </b><b>to</b><b>
dual boot with an existing </b><b>Windows system </b><b>- so that at
boot time the actual system that is booted can be selected from a
grub </b><b>boot </b><b>menu which will allow Windows to be selected
rather than the </b><b>newly installed</b><b> </b><b>Wasta </b><b>Linux
system. </b><b>Th</b><b>ese instructions, when followed carefully</b><b>,</b><b>
will </b><b>allow you to preserve the data on the Windows partitions
as well as the Windows system itself. The Windows partition(s) will
be shrunk down in size to provide </b><b>free space on your </b><b>hard
drive for the </b><b>Wasta </b><b>Linux installation. Although this
process can be done without wiping out data from the computer, it is
always good to make sure you</b><b> have backed up all data </b><b>to
an external drive </b><b>before proceeding with these installation
steps. Step </b><b>4</b><b> below is where changes </b><b>are

This
document is an illustrated guide that shows how to install Wasta
Linux to dual boot with an existing Windows system. If you want to
install Wasta Linux, but you need to keep the computer’s ability to
boot to either Wasta Linux or to Windows (dual boot), this document
shows you how to do that installation.</p>
<h3 class="western">Who is this document for?</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">This document is designed to be a guide
for an Advisor, Consultant, or Technician with some knowledge about
booting and operating systems - or wants to learn! This document
describes how to make radical changes to the computer that cannot be
easily reversed. The booting process for some computers can be
different from other computers, so this document cannot predict all
possible scenarios that might occur during the process of booting,
shrinking the existing Windows system, and installing Wasta along
side Windows. Hence, there is some risk that this process could turn
your computer into a “brick” that can no longer boot to any
operating system. That risk, I think, is small, but not zero. I think
it is worth the risk, and if you also think so please proceed. The
document is well illustrated with screenshots throughout. You will
find it helpful if you read through the whole document before trying
to execute it step by step. Note: The first 3 Steps of this document
link to the companion document entitled: <b>“<a href="How%20to%20install%20Wasta%20Linux%20totally%20replacing%20Windows.html">How
to install Wasta Linux totally replacing Windows</a>”.</b></p>
<h3 class="western">When does it make sense to use this procedure</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">It makes sense:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If you would like to switch to
	using Wasta Linux on your computer, but you cannot or do not feel
	free to totally remove Windows from the computer - at least at the
	present time.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If you have one or more
	Windows-only programs that you must use on the computer and for
	which there is no Linux equivalent or substitute, so you know there
	will be times that you will need to boot up the computer in Windows
	in order to use that Windows-only software. (Note: such situations
	are really very rare these days!).</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If you are tired of the expense
	and hassle of always being tied to Microsoft Windows with its
	licensing restrictions, its vulnerability to viruses and malware,
	its time-consuming updates, and its encroachment on your privacy.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If you want an operating system
	and software that is highly secure and efficient - and specially
	designed for the tasks that you do in your work.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Note: Putting Wasta Linux on an
	older Windows XP or other Windows computer is a good way to bring
	renewed life back into that computer. But, in such cases, we
	strongly recommend that you totally remove Windows from the old
	computer, and not set it up to dual boot to Wasta Linux as well as
	the old Windows system. Old Windows systems are no longer supported
	by Microsoft and have serious security vulnerabilities – so, each
	time you decide to boot to the old version of Windows, you subject
	the computer to those worsening security vulnerabilities. For a
	better choice, please see the document: <b>“<a href="How%20to%20install%20Wasta%20Linux%20totally%20replacing%20Windows.html">How
	to install Wasta Linux totally replacing Windows</a>”.</b>

Step 4. Use GParted to shrink the main Windows partition</h3>
<p>This step assumes you have successfully followed the first 3 steps
detailed in the companion document “<a href="How%20to%20install%20Wasta%20Linux%20totally%20replacing%20Windows.html"><b>How
to install Wasta Linux totally replacing Windows</b></a>” and are
currently booted to a “Live” session of Wasta Linux 16.04.1.1 on
your computer. Your desktop should be displaying the “Live”
session of Wasta’s desktop on your screen which looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Wasta-16.04.1.1-live-boot-desktop-install-icon-not-highlighted.png" name="Image1" align="left" width="665" height="458">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The existing Windows system normally reserves the entire disk
space for its own use. In order to make space for Wasta Linux to be
installed on the same computer, we will use the GParted program to
shrink the main Windows partition of the computer’s hard drive.</p>
<p>Start up the GParted program by selecting <b>GParted</b> from the
<b>Administration</b> category of the main <b>Menu</b> of the live
Wasta session:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Menu-Administration-GParted.png" name="Image2" align="left" width="606" height="380">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The GParted program will first ask you to type your password:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Enter-Password-for-GParted.png" name="Image3" align="left" width="500" height="184">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>GParted then scans the partitions that exist on the computer hard
drive and other storage devices, and displays its main program screen
which looks like the following example - from a computer with Windows
10 on it:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-Win10-initial-display.png" name="Image4" align="left" width="648" height="441">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Study the GParted display of your computer. The above illustration
is a sample only – your computer will certainly look different, but
there will be some similarities. The partitions that have an <b>ntfs</b>
type of file system are Windows partitions. Also partitions of the
&quot;fat32&quot; or &quot;fat&quot; type are Windows compatible
partitions. There is more <a href="#Partitions and partitioning – background information">background
information about computer partitions in the Appendix</a> at the end
of this document.</p>
<p>The above illustration shows a Windows 10 computer that has 2 <b>ntfs</b>
partitions; your computer may have 3 or more, and the size of your
partitions will almost certainly be different from those shown above.</p>
<p><b>You need to determine which ntfs partition on your computer is
the main Windows partition</b>. Look for the partition that has the
<b>largest </b><b>Size</b> – in Gigabytes (GiB). It should also
have the <b>largest Unused space</b>. The relative size of the disk’s
partitions is represented in the horizontal bar graph in the above
illustration. Some manufacturers label the main Windows partition
something like “Windows10_OS”, “Windows8_OS” or
“Windows7_OS”. Pay close attention to the difference between
Megabytes (MiB) and Gigabytes (GiB). It takes about a thousand
Megabytes to make one Gigabyte. So, in the illustration above the
first partition (/dev/sda1) is only half a Gigabyte (500 Megabytes or
MiB) in Size. The second partition (/dev/sda2) is 394.04 Gigabytes,
or about 394,000 Megabytes and it has about 345.54 GiB, or 345,540 MB
of unused space. Although it has no name in the Label column,
<b>clearly, the /dev/sda2 ntfs partition is </b><b>the </b><b>largest,
and has most unused space. </b><b>W</b><b>e will shrink </b><b>partition
sda2</b><b> </b><b>to make space for our Linux partitions </b><b>on
this computer.</b></p>
<h4 class="western">Tell GParted how you want to shrink the main
Windows partition</h4>
<p>Once you have determined which partition is your main Windows
partition, <b>click on </b><b>the line representing the main
partition</b><b> in GParted to </b><b>select/</b><b>highlight it</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">as shown in the illustration
below</span><span style="font-weight: normal">:</span></p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-select-partition-and-Resize-Icon.png" name="Image5" align="left" width="491" height="333">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>With the main Windows partition selected (sda2 in the above
example), click on the <b>Resize/</b><b>Move</b> icon in the tool
bar, as shown in the above illustration. After clicking on the Resize
button, the <b>Resize/Move</b> dialog should pop up over the main
GParted window:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-select-partition-and-Resize-dialog.png" name="Image6" align="left" width="482" height="328">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The pop up dialog shows a graphical representation of the main
Windows partition at the top of the dialog, and also shows some
information about this main partition. Our goal is to make this
Windows partition smaller, and at the same time, free up space on the
hard drive – space that we will later use to create some Linux
partitions in. Here is another view that only shows the Resize/Move
dialog:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-Resize-dialog-initial-size.png" name="Image7" align="left" width="573" height="310">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>We will make changes to this partition (/dev/sda2) using the
graphic at the top of the above dialog:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-select-partition-and-Resize-dialog-slider-function.png" name="Image8" align="left" width="547" height="200">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Within the graphic, note that the yellow shaded part at left
represents the “used” part of the partition – the part
containing data or files. The white part at right represents the part
of the partition that is “unused” - the part that has no data or
files on it. 
</p>
<p>Using your mouse click down on the slider at the right end and
hold it down while dragging the slider to the left – to a point
about half way within the white area – as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-select-partition-and-Resize-dialog-slider-at-middle.png" name="Image9" align="left" width="665" height="77">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The gray area that appears to the right of the slider arrow is
<b>freed space</b> – the space where we will create our Linux
partitions later. The Resize/Move dialog should now appear similar to
this:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-select-partition-and-Resize-dialog-drag-slider-to-half-of-unused-space.png" name="Image10" align="left" width="665" height="452">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The size numbers shown above are for illustration purposes only.
Your numbers will vary depending on the starting size of the Windows
main partition on your system, and the amount of data and files on
it. As you drag the slider to the left, the numbers in the <b>New
size (MiB)</b> and in the <b>Free space following (MiB)</b> boxes
automatically adjust proportionally, keeping the total of those two
values equal to the Maximum size available. The white space to the
left of the sizer is the unused space that will stay with the Windows
system, and the gray space labeled “Freed space” above is the
size that will become available for Linux partitions. The actual size
in MiB is shown in the “Free space following” box. You can adjust
the slider to whatever proportion you want to devote to each
operating system, but giving each operating system about half of the
available (white) space is a good starting point.</p>
<p>When you have adjusted the slider to the point you want, click on
the <b>Resize/Move</b> button in the lower right corner of the
dialog. Clicking the Resize/Move button will set up the resize
operation as a pending operation. 
</p>
<p><b>Remember: The changes you are making within GParted are not
made immediately on the actual computer. The changes are put into a
queue of “pending operations” which will only be executed when
you are ready to “Apply All Operations”.</b></p>
<p>After clicking on the <b>Resize/Move</b> button in the overlay
dialog, the main GParted screen will now look like this illustration
below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-select-partition-and-Resize-dialog-resized-apply-all-operations.png" name="Image11" align="left" width="665" height="452">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Notice that the graphic is now displaying what the main partition
(/dev/sda2) will look like <b>after</b> the pending operation has
been executed. If you were to “Clear all operations” (on the Edit
menu), or Quit the GParted program (from the GParted menu), no
changes would be made to the computer.</p>
<h4 class="western"><a name="Apply All Operations to shrink the Windows partition"></a>
Tell GParted to shrink the Windows partition</h4>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-Apply-all-operations-icon.png" name="Image16" align="left" width="51" height="55" border="0"/>
When
you are ready to shrink the Windows partition, click on the <b>Apply
All Operations icon</b> on the GParted tool bar (the icon with the
green tick mark). 
</p>
<p>You will be asked to confirm the operation:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-select-partition-and-Resize-dialog-resized-confirm-apply-all.png" name="Image12" align="left" width="563" height="163">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Click on the <b>Apply</b> button to execute the partition resize
operation. Be patient. The process can take a long time especially if
GParted needs to move data down to safety out of the area of the
partition that is being shrunk.</p>
<p> GParted will show a progress bar as the operation proceeds:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-select-partition-and-Resize-dialog-resized-applying-pending-progress.png" name="Image14" align="left" width="645" height="266">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>When the process completes it will show a dialog announcing “All
operations successfully completed” as shown in the illustration
below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-select-partition-and-Resize-dialog-resized-completed.png" name="Image13" align="left" width="619" height="420">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Click the <b>Close</b> button. The GParted screen will then show
the current state of computer’s Main Windows partition as shown in
the illustration below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-select-partition-and-Resize-dialog-resized-completed-new-unallocated-space-selected.png" name="Image15" align="left" width="611" height="415">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The “unallocated” space shown in the illustration above
(168.65 GiB) is where we will have the Wasta installer create our
Linux partitions as described below. Your unallocated space will be
different. 
</p>
<h3 class="western">Step 5. Create an Extended Partition in the newly
created unallocated space</h3>
<p>While the GParted program is still running, it is a good time to
see if we can create an <b>E</b><b>xtended</b> partition within the
unallocated space that we freed up in Step 4 above. The Extended
partition will be the “container” for the Linux partitions we
will create later during the actual installation of Wasta Linux.</p>
<p>With the “unallocated” line selected/highlighted as shown in
the image above, click on the <b>Partition</b> menu (at the top of
the GParted program screen), and select the <b>New</b> menu item as
shown in the screen illustration below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-select-partition-and-Add-New-menu.png" name="Image42" align="left" width="597" height="405">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>If there are 4 or more partitions showing in the GParted window at
this point, it is possible that GParted will not allow you to create
a new partition on the hard drive. If GParted presents you with this
error message when you try to create a new partition:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-select-partition-and-Create-New-Partition-Error-not-possible.png" name="Image60" align="left" width="575" height="211">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>it is likely that there are already the maximum number of 4
primary partitions on the hard drive. To remedy this situation please
skip down to the Appendix section entitled: “<a href="#If_the_partitioner_cannot_create_partitions">If
the partitioner cannot create partitions or the drive has ‘unusable’
space on it</a>” and follow the procedures detailed there before
you attempt to install the Wasta Linux system in Step 6.</p>
<p>If you don’t see the error message shown above, you should now
see a dialog that looks like the following illustration:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-select-partition-and-Create-New-Partition-dialog.png" name="Image51" align="left" width="620" height="284">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Click on the drop down arrow to access the <b>Create as</b> list
and select <b>Extended </b><b>Partition</b> as shown in the
illustration below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-select-partition-and-Create-New-Partition-select-Extended.png" name="Image52" align="left" width="665" height="310">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>With Extended Partition selected in the <b>Create as</b> list,
click on the <b>Add</b> button as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-select-partition-and-Create-New-Partition-select-Extended-Add.png" name="Image53" align="left" width="644" height="298">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>GParted will now show a <b>New Partition #1</b> - planned as a
pending operation within its graphical representation of the
partitions, as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-select-partition-and-Create-New-Partition-Extended-pending-operation.png" name="Image54" align="left" width="635" height="432">

<br/>

</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-Apply-all-operations-icon.png" name="Image59" align="left" width="51" height="55" border="0"/>
To
execute the pending operation and create the new Extended partition
click on the <b>Apply All Operations icon</b> in the GParted tool bar
as shown above. You will be asked to confirm the operation with this
message:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-select-partition-and-Resize-dialog-resized-confirm-apply-all.png" name="Image56" align="left" width="563" height="163">

of the Extended partition will be done quickly and you will see the

<p>The “extended” partition functions as a container. The
“unallocated” part of the extended partition is where we will
create the Linux partitions. We will not create the Linux partitions
during this session of GParted, but will do so below during the
installation of the Wasta system in Steps 6 and following.</p>
<p>So, select <b>Quit</b> from the GParted menu to close the GParted
program window for now. 
</p>
<p>Our next step will be to start up the Wasta installer while we are
still booted from the “Live” Wasta Linux memory stick. In the
remaining steps we will do the actual installation of the Wasta
system on the computer.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">We will not install these updates and
third-party software during the initial installation. You can do
updates after installation, so just leave the check boxes un-ticked,
and click <b>Continue</b>.</p>
<h3 class="western">Step 9. Installation type</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The next install wizard page wants to
know how you want Wasta Linux to be installed on the computer,
especially in relation to any existing operating system such as
Windows - or a previous Linux installation(s). The appearance of this
dialog will vary depending on what operating system(s) are already on
the computer. We are assuming here that some version of Windows is on
the computer.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The <b>Installatio</b><b>n type</b>
dialog will look similar to one of the dialogs shown below –
depending on the version of Windows that is resident on the computer.
Regardless of the type of Windows system on your computer, we will
always elect to do a manual partitioning of the hard drive – which
is always going to be the last option called “<b>Something else</b>”
in the Installation type that is presented to you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Therefore, if you are installing Wasta
Linux:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">to replace Windows XP, proceed

<h4 class="western"><a name="Why do we choose Something else"></a>Why
do we choose Something else?</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">It is possible to install Wasta Linux
using one of the other Installation type options, but this
documentation suggests choosing <b>Something else</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
for the </span><span style="font-weight: normal">following</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
reasons:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-weight: normal">The
	</span><b>Something else</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
	option allows us to have your </span><b>/home</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
	directory on a separate partition. Having </span><b>/home</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
	on a separate partition makes it easy to upgrade to a newer version
	of Wasta (or other kind of Linux) in the future without touching any
	of your documents, data or settings.</span></p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-weight: normal">The
	</span><b>Something else</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
	option </span><span style="font-weight: normal">allows us to choose
	the </span><b>size and arrangement</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
	of the partitions that will be created on the computer’s hard
	drive.</span></p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Different versions of Windows
	come with different numbers and kinds of partitions. By selecting
	<b>Something els</b>e, we can ensure that we can fit the Linux
	partitions within the unallocated space (we created earlier), so
	that the Linux and Windows partitions can co-exist and the computer
	can be booted to either Wasta or Windows at startup.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">While the first couple options
	in the above dialog may vary depending on how your Windows computer
	is set up, the last option for any installation will always be
	<b>Something else</b>. The <b>Something else</b> option therefore
	allows us to standardize this document, and reduce the number of
	possible variations and gotchas that might happen if we tried to
	describe one of the other options. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">We are not planning to encrypt
	the new Wasta installation, nor use the Logical Volume Management
	(LVM) system. The use of these technologies is not necessary in most
	environments. They are more complicated to set up at installation
	time and so are beyond the scope of this document.</p>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Note: The <b>Installation type</b>
dialogs shown above may differ a little from what you see on your
particular Windows computer, but the last option &quot;<b>Something
else</b>&quot; should always be available and is the one you should
select to follow this document. After selecting <b>Something else</b>,
click <b>C</b><b>ontinue.</b></p>
<h3 class="western">Step 10. Creating the Linux partitions</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The installation program uses a
partitioning program <span style="font-weight: normal">to show you </span>a
graphical display of the existing partitions that are on the
computer's hard drive. The Wasta installer calls on the services of
the GParted program, so the display will look quite similar to what
you saw while using GParted earlier to resize the main Windows
partition and create the extended partition. The graphics within the
installer will look a little different, but you should recognize the
general partitioning layout and the information it displays:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-Live-Install-initial-dialog.png" name="Image24" align="left" width="626" height="402">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The appearance and the number of
partitions displayed in the dialog you see will depend on what
partitions currently exist on your computer. You will want to study
the graph showing on your screen, and the information displayed on it
carefully.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If you already created the Extended
partition with Gparted in an earlier step that became sda3, you may
be wondering why an extended partition named sda3 is not showing in
the above dialog. During installation, the installer simply hides the
extended partitions and other things from view, and just represents
it as “free space” as shown above. The installer takes care of
the assignment of partition device names (as you will see below). 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The point of no return is the <b>Install
Now</b> button at the bottom right of this installation page. <b>Do
not click on that button until the end of Step </b><b>10</b>. Our
actions in creating Linux partitions are only <b>simulated</b> until
we get them just the way we want them. We can adjust them over and
over again without making actual changes to your computer. At any
time you can call it quits by clicking on the <b>Quit</b> button –
and no new changes will be made to your computer. <b>Again, don’t
click on the Install Now button until you are ready for the changes
to be made on your computer </b><b>(at the end of Step 10 below)</b><b>.</b></p>
<h4 class="western">Add the Linux partitions</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">We want to now start adding the Linux
partitions to the Extended/unallocated space. We will add <b>three</b>
logical partitions, <b>one at a time</b>:</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">A Linux root (/) partition with
	a size of 15GB (15000MB)</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">A Linux swap partition with a
	size of 4GB (4000MB)</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">A Home partition (/home) with
	the remainder of the free space</p>
</ol>
<h5 class="western">Add the Linux root / partition</h5>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The <b>first partition</b> we want to
add is the Linux <b>root (/) partition</b> with a size of 15GB or
15000MB.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Select</b><b> the free space line</b>
in the dialog, and click the <b>plus</b> button to add a new
partition as shown in the illustration below:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-Live-Install-free-space-selected.png" name="Image26" align="left" width="665" height="427">

</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If the “Create partition” dialog
pops up, skip down to the <a href="#Setting the data for the Linux root">Setting
the data for the Linux root / partition</a> section below.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Note: If, the partitioner won’t allow
you to add a new partition, and instead it shows the unused part of
the hard drive as “<b>unusable,</b>”  as shown in the following
sample:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/GParted-Live-Install-unusable-space-with-4-primary-partitions.png" name="Image25" align="left" width="514" height="164">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">then the hard drive already has the
maximum number of 4 primary partitions permitted on the hard drive.
If that is the case on your computer you will need to remove one or
more of the non-critical Windows partitions in order to be able to
create a new “<b>extended</b>” partition to hold the Linux
partitions. For instructions on how to do that, see the section “<a href="#If_the_partitioner_cannot_create_partitions">If
the partitioner cannot create partitions or the drive has unusable
space on it</a>”, then return here.</p>
<h5 class="western"><a name="Setting the data for the Linux root"></a>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Note that the partitioner named the new
Linux root partition <b>sda5</b> instead of <b>sda3</b> or <b>sda4
</b>that you might have expected. What happened to sda3 and sda4?
This seemingly odd partition naming is the result of creating our
first Linux partition as a “Logical” partition. During
installation, the system reserves some of the device names for its
“extended” partitions and “logical” partitions.</p>
<h5 class="western">Add the Linux swap partition</h5>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The <b>second partition</b> we want to
add is the Linux <b>swap</b> <b>partition</b> with a size of 4GB or

memory if it needs to. It is generally recommended to have a swap
partition that is </span><span style="font-weight: normal">at least

RAM memory in the computer. </span>If your computer has more than 4
GB then increase the swap size accordingly. For example, if you

tell more about how to handle this situation, and make it possible
for you to install the 3 Linux partitions we will add to your
computer’s hard drive during the installation of the Wasta Linux
system on your computer. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">First we’ll present some educational
background information about partitions and partitioning. But, if you

to recover the unusable space</a>.</p>
<h4 class="western"><a name="Partitions and partitioning – background information"></a>
Partitions and partitioning – background information</h4>
<p>In the realm of disk partitioning, there are three types of disk
partitions: primary, extended, and logical partitions. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">There are two partitioning schemes in
common use today:  the Master Boot Record or MBR partitioning scheme,
and the  GUID Partition Table or GPT partitioning scheme. The MBR
scheme is older and is gradually being replaced by the newer GPT
scheme.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p>A disk with a traditional partition table (MBR) can only have up
to 4 partitions. In the MBR scheme, each disk can have up to 4
primary partitions or 3 primary partitions and 1 extended partition.
If you need 4 partitions or less, you can just create them as primary
partitions. Extended and logical partitions are a way to get around
this limitation, but logical partitions must be created within an
extended partition container – and that extended partition
container itself must take the place of one of the 4 possible primary
partitions.</p>
<p>If you want to have 6 partitions on a single drive, one way to do
that is to create 3 primary partitions and 1 extended partition in
the last primary partition slot. The extended partition effectively
functions as a container that allows you to create more logical
partitions within that extended partition container. So then, if you
needed 6 partitions, you can create 3 primary partitions, 1 main
extended partition, and then 3 more logical (extended) partitions
inside the main extended partition. You could also just create a
single primary partition, an extended partition container, and put 5
logical (extended) partitions inside the main extended partition. The
main restriction for the MBR scheme is that you cannot have more than
4 primary partitions at a time. 
</p>
<p>Here is an example illustrating how the partitioning was done for
a typical laptop computer after it had been configured to dual boot
to either Windows 10 or to Wasta Linux. The illustration below is
derived from the Linux “Disks” program that is part of Wasta
Linux. It is not a view of the partitioning you will see during
installation:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Dual_Boot_Disks_View_of_partitions.png" name="Image40" align="left" width="665" height="329">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In the above illustration notice the
following:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p>Partition 1, Partition 2, and Partition 3 are “Primary
	partitions” that came with the Windows computer. Partition 1 is
	the System partition; Partition 2 is the main Windows partition, and
	Partition 3 is the Recovery partition. Before we added the Extended
	Partition 4, we shrank down the Windows Partition 2, and moved the
	Recovery Partition 3 (without changing its size) to the left to
	align with the right end of the shrunken Windows partition 2. That
	left about 341 GB of free space at the right end of the drive for
	creating the Extended partition 4.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Partition 4 is an “Extended Partition” - it is a
	container residing in the 4<sup>th</sup> primary slot and contains
	additional logical (extended) partitions. Notice that the Extended
	Partition 4 becomes a container that spans over the 3 logical
	partitions shown below it in the above illustration.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Partition 5, Partition 6, and Partition 7 are the logical
	(extended) partitions existing within the main extended partition 4
	that spans above them. Sometimes an installer may skip a partition
	number when configuring logical partitions – so the logical
	partitions shown above might become Partition 6, Partition 7 and
	Partition 8, instead of 5, 6, and 7 as shown above.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Notice there are two small areas of “Free Space” - one
	at the end of the disk space and another one between logical
	partition 6 and 7. The partitioner will create these automatically
	if needed in order to align the partitions most efficiently.</p>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">As mentioned above, the older
partitioning scheme is the Master Boot Record or MBR partitioning
scheme as described above, but it is still very common and the
easiest scheme for installing a Wasta system alongside Windows on a
single computer. The MBR scheme is limited to 4 Windows <b>primary</b>
partitions (but one of those can be configured as an extended
partition for containing logical partitions) as described above.
Because of the 4 primary partition limitation of the MBR partitioning
scheme, much of this document focuses on how to install additional
Linux partitions under the MBR partitioning scheme.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The GUID Partition Table or GPT scheme
is a standard for the layout of the partition table on a physical
storage device, such as a hard disk drive or solid-state drive, using
globally unique identifiers (called “GUID”). GPT is newer
partitioning scheme that is becoming increasingly popular since it
can directly handle more than 4 partitions (up to 128), and the GPT
drive format lets you set up drives that are larger than 4 terabytes
(TB) – with each partition size up to 18 exabytes (about 18.8
million terabytes) of space. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Wasta Linux is fully compatible with
both the MBR and the GPT partitioning schemes. A computer equipped
with GPT partitioned drive would be an easy environment for
installing Linux, except for some complications that can arise due to
the use of a security feature called “Secure Boot”.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The GPT partitioning scheme has
supported the “Secure Boot” feature since 2012, but manufacturers
have varied in the way and extent to which they have implemented the
feature. For our purposes in installing Linux on a Windows computer,
the Secure Boot mechanism - and the way it is implemented - make it
more difficult to boot from a “Live” Wasta Linux memory stick and
install Wasta Linux. As a result, Wasta documentation gives guidance
on how to turn off Secure Boot as part of the Wasta Linux
installation process (see the details in Step 1 of the “<a href="How%20to%20install%20Wasta%20Linux%20totally%20replacing%20Windows.html#Step%201">How
to install Wasta Linux totally replacing Windows</a>” document).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Hard drives need at least one partition
in order to be able to store programs and data. The Windows operating
system requires at least one primary partition to boot its system,
and that primary partition needs to be the first partition on the
first hard drive (drive 0) recognized by the system. The Linux
operating system is the really flexible guy in the neighborhood.
Linux can boot itself from almost anywhere - without the requirement
of having its system being stored on a primary partition, or the
first partition on the first hard drive in the system.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Note: You cannot modify a partition
while it’s in-use.  For example, you cannot delete or resize a
Windows system partition while Windows itself is running from that
partition. This is one reason that we need to boot from a Linux live
memory stick to make partitioning changes. A partition may also be
in-use under Windows, if Windows is not fully “shut down”, or is
in “sleep” or “hibernation” mode in which it has saved part
of its operating system and data to a temporary location without
completely shutting down the system. For this reason you should
always make sure than Windows is fully shut down – and not
sleeping, or hybernating, or in some other temporary state before
installing Linux with the Live memory stick.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The newer partitioning scheme is called
GPT which allows virtually unlimited number of partitions on a hard
drive. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Manufacturers of Windows computers used
to supply separate media disks for Windows system recovery. In more
recent times, however, it is likely that the manufacturer set up the
partitioning for your Windows system with one or more primary
partitions dedicated as recovery or backup partitions - in lieu of
supplying you with physical DVDs or other external recovery/backup
media. 
</p>
<h4 class="western">Default Partition Layout of Windows computers</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The partitions that come on a Windows
computer can vary a lot in number, size, order of arrangement and
naming. Various computer manufacturers also tend to modify the
recommended partition setup that Microsoft specifies, and sometimes
add one or more additional partitions. The Windows operating system
is much more rigid than Linux as to where the partition is located
that contains its system and boot loading files. Generally for
Windows, a <b>System</b> partition must be the first partition on the
first disk that is recognized by the computer system’s firmware.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The tricky part is that various
computer manufacturers may put different labels on the partitions
they create on their Windows-equipped computers. They may also add
one or more additional partitions for backup purposes and also for
“value added” things – also commonly called “bloat-ware”. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Basic Rule: Generally speaking, on a
Windows system, any partitions that are located before (to the left
of) the main (and largest) Windows partition (see the partition
layout diagrams below), are critical to the operating of the Windows
operating system. They should not be changed or moved. Any partitions
that are located after (to the right of) the main Windows partition,
are auxiliary and not critical to the day-to-day operation of the
Windows system.</b></p>
<h5 class="western">BIOS – based Windows computers</h5>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">For BIOS-based computers, Microsoft
specifies a default partition layout for Windows that includes the
following: a system partition, a Windows partition, and a recovery
tools partition, as shown in the graphic below:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Partitioning-Win10-default-partition-layout-for-BIOS-pcs.png" name="Image41" align="left" width="665" height="102">

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I<b>mplications f</b><b>or dual
booting</b>: If your computer has only 3 partitions similar to what
is shown in the above illustration, you can usually just add 1 main
<b>extended</b> partition, and create the 3 Linux partitions as
logical (extended) partitions within that extended partition. If you
find 4  or more primary partitions on your Windows computer, so that
after shrinking the Windows partition down to make space available
for Linux, that space is “unusable”, you can probably safely
delete one or more of the additional partitions after (to the right
of) the main Windows partition - leaving the 3 Windows partitions
shown above (System, Windows and Recovery). 
</p>
<h5 class="western">UEFI – based Windows computers</h5>
<p>For UEFI-based computers, Microsoft specifies a default partition
layout for Windows that includes the following: a system partition,
an Microsoft Reserved Partition (called a MSR), a Windows partition,
and a recovery tools partition, as shown in the graphic below:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Partitioning-Win10-default-partition-layout-for-UEFI-pcs.png" name="Image43" align="left" width="665" height="102">

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I<b>mplications for dual booting</b>:
If your computer has 4 partitions (or more) similar to what is shown
in the above illustration, and the disk uses the MBR partitioning
scheme, you may need to determine which which of the 4 or more
primary partitions can be deleted in order to make usable free space
to install the Wasta Linux partitions. If, after shrinking the
Windows partition down to make space available for Linux, that freed
space turns out to be “unusable”, you can probably safely delete
the Recovery partition, and any other primary partition to the right
of the main Windows partition - leaving the first 3 Windows
partitions shown above (System, MSR and the main Windows partition). 
</p>
<h4 class="western"><a name="How_to_recover_the_unusable_space"></a>How
to recover the unusable space</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">This section describes how to recover
the unusable space, and successfully create an extended partition in
that space in preparation for the installation of the Wasta Linux
system. It assumes that the reason for the unusable space is that
there are already 4 primary partitions as part of the Windows system
MBR configuration on the computer’s hard drive. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Our strategy will be the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p>Remove one or more of the non-critical Windows partitions
	(leaving just 3 primary partitions)</p>
	<li/>
<p>Move a non-critical Windows partition back to maximize the
	free space for Linux</p>
	<li/>
<p>Create an Extended partition within the free space (where
	Linux partitions will be created during Linux installation)</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The following GParted screen

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If your GParted screen does not show a
significant amount of unallocated space you should go back up to <a href="#Step 4 - Use GParted to shrink the main Windows partition">Step

the main Windows partition, then return here to continue with this
procedure.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In order to add Linux partitions, we
need to remove one or more of the non-critical Windows partitions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Assuming GParted shows that you have at
least 4 partitions, select/highlight the <b>last</b> partition in
your GParted list of partitions, as shown in the illustration above
(it is the sda4 partition above). Then click on the <b>Delete
partition icon</b> in the tool bar as shown in the illustration
below:</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Notice that we now have “unallocated”
space in two different parts of the hard drive: (1) 168.65 GiB of
space that we freed up by shrinking the main Windows partition
earlier, and (2) 6.84 GiB that was just freed by the deletion of
partition sda4. The sda3 partition is now located in between the two
unallocated spaces. To best utilize the hard drive space, we will now
<b>move</b> the sda3 partition (labeled “Lenovo_Recovery”) <b>up</b>
to reside adjacent to the sda2 main Windows partition – moving it
up without changing its size. That will result in all of the
unallocated space merging together and residing at the end of the
hard drive – which is more ideal.</p>
