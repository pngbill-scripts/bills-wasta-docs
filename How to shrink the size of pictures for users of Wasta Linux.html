<h3 class="western">When does it make sense to use this procedure</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It makes sense:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">When you want
	to produce copies of your photos that take up less disk space but
	are good for viewing on a computer screen.</p>

</ul>
<h4 class="western">Pixel</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A <b>pixel</b>
is a point of light or a dot of ink that, together with many other
pixels, make up a photo or image on a computer/mobile screen or a
printer. For example, the period at the end of each of these
sentences is small, but at least 8 pixels contribute to its image on
my color computer screen. Here is what that period looks like
magnified 40 times:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Pinta-Program-pixels-period-on-color-screen.png" name="Image21" align="left" width="312" height="219">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The 8
pixels in the above image are the 8 squares with various shades of
<b>r</b>ed, <b>g</b>reen and <b>b</b>lue (RGB).  When your eyes look
at groups of pixels on a color screen, they are so small that your
eyes cannot distinguish the various colors of each individual pixel.
Your eyes automatically mix those colors together. So, when you look
at those 8 pixels at their actual size on a screen, your eyes
automatically mix the 8 colored pixels together and perceive the
object to be a black period. Color printers do a similar thing by
printing ink dots of different color mixes (including black ink) that
our eyes perceive to be a printed period. If you were to rotate the
above image quickly – or blink your eyes fast enough – while
looking at the image above, the colors would mix together and it
would appear to be a black dot. 
</p>
<h4 class="western">Normal Image Size, Resolution, and Zoom or Scale</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Photos
viewed on screens and their printed forms consist of collections of
pixels. The <b>normal image size</b> is the image’s <b>width in
pixels times its height in pixels</b>. For example an image that is
2400 pixels wide and 2000 pixels high would have an image size of
2400 x 2000 = 4,800,000 pixels or 4.8 megapixels (4.8 million
pixels). We can refer to the image as a “2400 by 2000 image”, or
a “4.8 megapixel image”. Cameras today typically create images
that consist of many millions of pixels (megapizels) – sometimes up
to 16 or 20 megapixels!</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
<b>resolution</b> of a computer or mobile screen is the density of
physical pixels that exist in the screen. The density is often
expressed in terms of “pixels-per-inch”. The overall width and
height of the screen is the result of its pixel density and the
number of physical pixels the manufacturer made into the screen. The
more pixels that are put into a certain screen, the higher its
resolution, and the more detail an image displayed on that screen can
hold. Most computer screens and mobile devices of Wasta users, have a
density of 72 pixels-per-inch ( 72 PPI) or 96 pixels-per-inch (96
PPI). Since computer and mobile phone screens are generally limited
to 72 or 96 PPI, they are not large enough to display images at their
<b>normal image size</b> – where one image pixel occupies one
screen pixel. They have to be displayed with a <b>zoom</b> or <b>scale</b>
setting of <b>less than 100%</b> in order to view the whole image on
the screen.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">For
example, if the normal image size is 2400 x 2000 (4.8 megapizels),
the image would display 25 inches wide by about 20.8 inches high on
your computer screen with a resolution of 96 pixels-per-inch [2400 <font face="Times New Roman, serif">÷
</font><font face="Times New Roman, serif">96 = </font><font face="Times New Roman, serif">25
inches wide, and 2000 </font><font face="Times New Roman, serif">÷
</font><font face="Times New Roman, serif">96 = 20.8 inches high</font>].
Therefore, when you view a large megapixel image that comes directly
from your camera, the Wasta image viewer will automatically “<b>zoom</b>”
or “<b>scale</b>” it to a smaller viewable size so that it fits
within your computer or mobile phone screen. That is helpful to allow
you to see the whole image, but you might not realize that a lot of
the pixel image information of those large images is “ignored” or
“wasted” when the image is zoomed or scaled to show the whole
image to you on your screen.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Most
digital cameras today produce photos with millions of pixels – so
many in fact that there are a lot more pixels than will fit on our
screens. This is why we can use programs like Pinta to make copies of
our photos that are greatly reduced or “scaled down” in their
number of total pixels. They will still be large enough and look good
on our 72 and 96 pixels-per-inch screens. In Step 4 below you will
use Pinta to resize an image to a reasonable size for sharing and
viewing on computer screens. 
</p>
<h4 class="western">Image compression and quality</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Most
cameras today produce image files that are <b>compressed</b>. The
most common form of compressed image file is the JPEG file – files
with a .jpg or .JPG extension. JPEG compression can reduce the
physical size of image files by just a little, or by a lot. The more
an image file is compressed by JPEG compression, the more image data
is lost. The quality of an image can deteriorate if the image is
compressed too much. Even so, JPEG compression can easily shrink
image files down to 1/10th their original size with very little loss
of perceptible image <b>quality</b>. In Step 5 below you will use
Pinta to adjust the <b>quality</b> of an image file when that file is
saved to disk.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Upload your pictures from your camera"></a>
Upload your pictures from your camera to your Wasta computer</h3>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Most
cameras and mobile phones have a method for uploading pictures to a
computer. This guide illustrates a way to copy files from a Panasonic
Lumix camera using the camera’s USB cable. 
</p>
<h4 class="western">Plug your camera into your computer using the
camera’s USB cable</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Plug
in your camera to your computer</b> with the camera’s USB cable,
then <b>turn your camera on</b>. The camera should allow you to
“Connect to your PC” by <b>clicking the camera’s OK button</b>.
The Wasta system should automatically start up the File Manager. An
illustration might look like this:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Picture-Transfer-from-camera-Files-initial-view.png" name="Image22" align="left" width="642" height="344" border="0"/>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Note
that the File Manager program mounted the camera’s memory card and
named it <b>16GB Volume </b><span style="font-weight: normal">under
the </span><b>Devices</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> list in
the left side bar in the above illustration</span>. Your camera’s
photo device may be named differently. Note also the messages in the
blue highlight above the camera device’s folders. It says “The
media contains digital photos” and provides a button at right that
you can click to “Open Shotwell Photo Manager”. Using the
Shotwell program is a good way to organize your photos into albums,
however, in this guide we not focus on using the Shotwell program.
Instead, we will show you how to make copies of a couple photos that
are in the camera’s storage area, and paste them into a sub-folder
of your computer’s Pictures folder called “Temporary for filing”.
Once located on your computer, we will show how to shrink one of the
photos to a much smaller size for sharing with your friends.</p>
<h4 class="western">Use File Manager to navigate to the camera’s
photo storage folder</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-weight: normal">Most
digital cameras create a folder in their photo storage area called
</span><b>DCIM</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> (for </span><b>D</b><span style="font-weight: normal">igital
</span><b>C</b><span style="font-weight: normal">amera </span><b>IM</b><span style="font-weight: normal">ages).
</span><b>D</b><b>ouble click on the</b><b> DCIM folder</b> in the
File Manager to open the DCIM folder. You should see a sub-folder of
the DCIM folder also created by your camera:  
</p>

  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Your
camera’s DCIM folder will likely have at least one sub-folder whose
name begins with a three-digit number (from 100 to 999), followed by
a 4 or 5 letter abbreviation for the brand of the camera. If there
are more than one such folders, you may need to open each one to find
the one with the pictures you want to process. 
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Double
click on the desired sub-folder. In the above illustration the
sub-folder is it named <b>100_PANA</b> by my <b>Pana</b>sonic camera.
You should now see a list of the still photos that are contained on
your camera’s storage area:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In the

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
File Manager will remember that you want to copy the selected files.
Note: We will only make copies of these files. We will not remove
them from the camera’s storage area. That way you could still use
the Shotwell Photo Manager later if you decide to do so, and archive
the original photos in an organized album on your computer.

shrinking it from its original size of 5.9 Megabytes to a much
smaller size of 55 KB! Even though the resulting photo will be only
about 1% of the size of the original, it will still be a decent

<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Click
on the main Menu button at the lower-left corner of your Wasta
Desktop. Then click on the Graphics category, and finally click on
the Pinta program menu item as shown in the following illustration:</p>

<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
Pinta program should start up and appear similar to this
illustration:</p>

<br/>

</p>
<h4 class="western">Step 2: Open a photo within Pinta</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Click
on the Pinta program’s <b>File</b> menu and select the <b>Open…</b>
menu item as shown below:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Pinta-Program-File-Open-Menu.png" name="Image4" align="left" width="200" height="219">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
Pinta program will display an <b>Open Image file</b> dialog, showing
you the contents of your Pictures folder. You need to click on the
sub-folder containing a photo you want to open within Pinta. In our
illustration we know that the photos are located in a sub-folder
called <b>Temporary for filing</b>. You should navigate to and click
on the folder where your photo is located, then click on the <b>Open</b>
button in the lower right corner of the dialog to open that
sub-folder, until in your case you see the photos you want listed in
the main window of the dialog. In our case we have two photos that
our camera named P1000953.JPG and P1000954.JPG, and they appear in
the main window with the first photo file already highlighted, and
with a preview of the photo within the right-side of the main window,
looking like this:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">With
the photo you want to open in Pinta highlighted/selected, click on
the <b>Open</b> button. Pinta will open the photo and display it in
its main window – read to edit:</p>

</img>
<br/>

</p>
<h4 class="western">Step 3: Crop the image to help bring the part you
want to show into better view (optional)</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">You can
crop the photo to focus in on the subject matter, and eliminate parts
of the picture that can be omitted from view. Cropping also can make
a picture take up a smaller disk space. If you hover your mouse over
the Tools in the Tools sidebar, you will see that the upper left tool
is the Rectangle Select tool. Click on the “Rectangle Select”
tool:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Pinta-Program-File-Open-Ready-Click-Rect-Select.png" name="Image7" align="left" width="285" height="210">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">You
will notice that the mouse pointer becomes a cross-hair pointer. You
can click and drag the mouse pointer from one corner of the desired
crop area to its opposite corner, and then release the mouse button.
The rectangle shaped area is bordered by a dashed line. If the dashed
rectangle is not positioned quite right click anywhere on the image
to remove it and try dragging a new selection rectangle – until you
get the desired view selected within the dashed rectangle. My
rectangle for cropping looks like this:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Pinta-Program-File-Open-Ready-Crop-Rect-Showing.png" name="Image9" align="left" width="540" height="338">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Note
that when cropped the part of the image outside the dashed rectangle
will be removed. With the part you want selected, crop the image by
clicking the <b>Image</b> menu and selecting <b>Crop to Selection </b><span style="font-weight: normal">as
illustrated below</span><b>:</b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Pinta-Program-File-Open-Ready-Image-Crop-Menu.png" name="Image8" align="left" width="350" height="261">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
part of the image that was within the dashed rectangle will now fill
the main window:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Pinta-Program-File-Open-Ready-Image-Crop-Result.png" name="Image10" align="left" width="503" height="375">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> If you
do not like the crop result, you can click on the Undo button in the
Pinta tool bar to undo your action(s) and try again. Cropping an
image can often make it look better and reduce its size on disk. <b>Our
original photo took up 5.9 MB on disk. After cropping the photo
shrunk to 1.3 MB on disk. Cropping made the image shrink down to use
just 22% of the original disk space.</b></p>
<h4 class="western">Step 4: Resize the image</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We will
now resize the image. With the image displaying in the Pinta main
window, click on the <b>Image</b> menu and select the <b>Resize
Image…</b> menu item as shown below:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Pinta-Program-File-Open-Ready-Image-Resize-Menu.png" name="Image11" align="left" width="393" height="294">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
Resize Image dialog initially appears like this illustration:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Pinta-Program-File-Open-Ready-Image-Resize-Dlg.png" name="Image12" align="left" width="273" height="225">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Pinta
allows you to resize the image “By percentage” or “By absolute
size”. The “By percentage” option is selected by default, and
it starts at 100% - which would be no change in size. You would need
to change 100 to a smaller percentage to make the image smaller. What
value should you use? 
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
“Width” and “Height” in pixels information can help you
decide which method of resizing is best for this photo. In the above
illustration the Width of the cropped photo is 2871 pixels and the
Height is 2666 pixels. That is actually still a very large image. If
this image were displayed on a computer screen (at the common screen
resolution of 96 pixels-per-inch) at its “natural” size it would
span about 30 inches wide and 28 inches tall! Typically, the width
between the left and right margins of a LibreOffice document page
displaying on a computer screen is about 660 pixels (about 7 inches)
when the document zoom is showing the page at 100%. So, if we wanted
our 2871 pixel wide photo to span the area from a document’s left
margin over to its right margin filling the width of the entire page,
we could either calculate the percentage we would need to reduce the
image size (660 <font face="Times New Roman, serif">÷</font> 2871 <font face="Times New Roman, serif">×</font>
100 = 23%), or it would be easier to simply choose the option “<b>By
absolute size</b>”, and then change the <b>Width</b> value in
pixels from 2871 to 660, as shown in the illustration below:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Pinta-Program-File-Open-Ready-Image-Resize-Dlg-By-absolute-size-changed-width-to-660.png" name="Image13" align="left" width="244" height="199">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Note
that after entering 660 in the Width box, the Height value will
adjust automatically to the correct value if you simply click in the
Height box with your mouse pointer – as long as the “Maintain
aspect ratio” stays selected (which is will be by default). Now
click the <b>OK</b> button to effect the resize. 
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">You may
be surprised to see the result of the Resize operation which
initially looks like this:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Pinta-Program-File-Open-Ready-Image-Resize-Dlg-By-absolute-size-changed-initial-view.png" name="Image14" align="left" width="528" height="396">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
result is misleading. The reason it appears so “small” is because
the image was initially so large when loaded into Pinta that Pinta
set its zoom value very small (probably about 20%) so that all of the
image could be seen within its main window. To see the image
displayed now at its <b>normal</b> size, click on the <b>View</b>
menu and select <b>Normal Size</b>, as shown below:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
image is displayed at its “normal size” and fills Pinta’s main
window as shown in this illustration:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>

  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Note:
You may need to move the scroll bars a little to see the whole image,
depending on the size of Pinta’s program window on your screen.
<b>After our resize operation, the cropped image (1.3 MB) shrunk was
down to occupy only 112 KB of disk space. The size of our photo is
now just 2% of its original size, but it was still large enough to
fill the width of a full page in a word processing document! </b>
</p>
<h4 class="western">Step 5: Save the new image with a different name
and change its compression value</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We have
one more step to do. We need to <b>save</b> the image <b>as </b><span style="font-weight: normal">a
photo with a </span><span style="font-weight: normal">n</span><span style="font-weight: normal">ew
name in order to retain our original file, and distinguish our

  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Give
your new cropped and resized file a <b>new name </b>in the Name box.
In the illustration above the file that was originally called
P1000953.JPG I’ve renamed it to a more descriptive name in the Name
box “Compost-garden-collecting-lettuce.JPG”. 
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Suggestion</b><b>s</b>:
</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	Save Image File dialog shown above can be used to rename files so
	that the new version of the file doesn’t overwrite the original
	version. You simply change the name in the Name box. For example, if
	you had previously named the original file when it came from the
	camera to a descriptive name such as
	“Compost-garden-collecting-lettuce.JPG”, you might name this new
	file in a way that shows how it is different from the original –
	something like “Compost-garden-collecting-lettuce-lowres.JPG” or
	even “Compost-garden-collecting-lettuce-lowres-660px.JPG”. In
	the first case the new name identifies the file as a “lowres”
	(low resolution) version of the original. In the second case the new
	name identifies the file as being both a lowres version, and its
	name further tells that it has a width of 660 pixels.</p>
	<li/>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
	<b>Save Image File</b> dialog shown above can also be used to save
	the processed photo to a different folder from the “Temporary for
	filing” folder location shown above. You can do that by clicking
	on the <b>Pictures</b> folder button, then navigating within the
	dialog to a different sub-folder within the main Pictures folder –
	before pressing Save to save the file.</p>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Pinta
will the show you the “JPEG Quality” dialog which appears like
this illustration:</p>

<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
first time you save a file within Pinta it will probably set the
Quality value to 85 or higher. For most photos that people will view
on a computer screen, you can safely set the Quality value to around
50 without any noticeable degrading of the photo’s quality. <b>To
change the Quality value simply grab the circle on the slider with

<h4 class="western">Step 6: Close Pinta, and share your more
efficiently processed photos!</h4>
<h4 class="western">What did our photo processing within Pinta
accomplish?</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-weight: normal">We
showed that it is possible to shrink photos down to as little as 1%
of their original disk space without loosing a good viewing size and
without sacrificing quality for viewing on computer screens. Reducing
the disk size of photos as described can also save you a lot of
Internet connection time if you have a low Internet connection. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Y</span><span style="font-weight: normal">ou
can also save a lot on </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Internet

<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<h4 class="western">What if you plan to print your photos?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal">The Pinta photo processing
described in the above steps is designed for displaying images on a
computer screen most of which display images at 72 or 9</span><span style="font-weight: normal">6</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
pixels-per-inch. It is quite suitable for sharing images with people
who will be viewing them on a computer screen. Your Pinta photo
process, however, might be a bit different if you want to print your
images. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">M</span><span style="font-weight: normal">ost
printers, are able to print at 300 pixels-per-inch resolution. Some
can print at 600 pixels-per-inch or even 1200 </span><span style="font-weight: normal">or
2400 </span><span style="font-weight: normal"> pixels-per-inch. </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal">You might want to experiment.
I’ve found that the above steps work quite well for most photos
that I put into a newsletter and print them using a color laser
printer. Occasionally I will use a higher resolution in </span><b>Step

possibly </span><b>increase the JPEG Quality to 60 or 70 </b><b>when
