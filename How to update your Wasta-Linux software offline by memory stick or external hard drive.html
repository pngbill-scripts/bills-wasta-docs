How to update your Wasta-Linux software offline<br/>
by memory stick
or external hard drive<br/>

<h3 class="western">What is this document?</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Wasta-logo-low-res.jpg" name="Image55" align="left" width="331" height="71" border="0"/>
This
document is an illustrated guide that shows how to keep your Wasta
Linux software up to date using a memory stick or an external drive
containing the updated software packages. One of the most powerful
features of Wasta is the ability to do a simple upgrade of ALL the
user's software applications, plus Wasta itself, and without
disturbing their language data, and WITHOUT the necessity of a good
Internet connection. In fact, all software updates can be done
without any access to the Internet. The program for this is called
<strong>Wasta-offline</strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">
</span></strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">and it</span></strong>
is already present to run in any version of Wasta.</p>
<h3 class="western">Who is this document for?</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">This document is
designed to be a guide for Wasta computer users who have created or
have been given a memory stick or an external USB hard drive
containing software updates.</p>
<h3 class="western">When does it make sense to use this procedure</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It makes sense:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If you were
	given a memory stick or external hard drive containing software
	updates to be installed on your computer (without accessing the
	Internet)</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If you
	created a memory stick or external hard drive containing software
	updates to be installed on your computer, and possibly other Wasta
	computers (without accessing the Internet)</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Your Internet
	access is slow, or expensive, and you have multiple Wasta computers
	to update</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">You need to
	update the software on many Wasta Linux computers and want the
	updating process to be as fast and efficient as possible</p>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The memory stick or
external hard drive has pre-loaded all the updates for the various
software packages that the user already has installed in Wasta. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The developers of
open source software are continuously updating their software to
improve it and to fix any bugs or security issues. Therefore, keeping
your software up to date can involve downloading a lot of large files
from the Internet. That is not a big problem if you have adequate
(and relatively inexpensive) Internet access. If that is the case,
then you do not need to use the wasta-offline system or follow the
procedures described in this document. However, most of the Wasta
computer users in regions like PNG and the greater Pacific Islands
are not going to be in such a situation.</p>

</ul>
<h3 class="western">Getting Started</h3>
<p><strong>To start, insert the latest wasta-offline mem</strong><strong>ory</strong><strong>
stick or external drive that contains the latest software upgrades
already installed.</strong></p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Inserting-memory-stick.png" name="Image1" align="left" width="400" height="267">
  <br clear="left"/>

<br/>
<br/>

<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Plug-in-Wasta-Offline-External-Drive.png" name="Image17" align="left" width="464" height="349">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The wasta-offline program should automatically run about 10
seconds after you plug in the memory stick or external drive. If the
wasta-offline program starts automatically skip down to the section
called &quot;<a href="#When_wasta_offline_starts_automatically">When
wasta-offline starts automatically</a>&quot; below. If the
wasta-offline program does not start automatically follow the
“Starting wasta-offline manually...” section below.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Starting_wasta_offline_manually"></a>Starting
wasta-offline manually (if it does not start automatically)</h3>
<p>In some cases wasta-offline may not start up automatically when
the memory stick or external USB drive is plugged in. This might be
the case if the user's computer has an early version of Wasta, or is
running some other version of Linux, on which wasta-offline has not
yet been installed.</p>
<p>There are several ways you can start up a program in Wasta Linux. 
</p>
<h4 class="western">Startup method 1: Find it and run it from the
main Menu’s Administration category</h4>
<p>The wasta-offline program can be started from the main Wasta Menu
by clicking on the <b>Menu</b> icon at the lower left of the screen,
then selecting the <b>Administration</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">category,</span> and
scrolling the list at right down to the <b>wasta [Offline]</b> menu
item and clicking on it as shown in the Menu illustration below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Wasta-Offline-on-main-menu1.png" name="Image18" align="left" width="521" height="448">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h4 class="western">Startup method 2: Start typing the name wasta in
the Menu’s search box</h4>
<p>Some people prefer to start a program by searching for it by name.
If you know the name of a program you can click on the Wasta main
<b>Menu</b>, and <b>start typing the name of a program</b> (or just
the first part of the name of the program) in the search box at the
top of the main Menu. As you type the name the possible matches are
shown in the list at right as shown in the Menu illustration below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Wasta-Offline-on-main-menu2.png" name="Image2" align="left" width="665" height="579">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>When the menu item <b>wasta [Offline]</b> appears in the list you
can click on it to start it running. If you completely type the
entire name of the program – wasta-offline – only that program
will appear in the list at right, and it will be automatically
highlighted and pressing Enter will start it running.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h4 class="western">Startup method 3: Type the program name in a
command prompt</h4>
<p>Other people who do not like navigating in menus, may use a pop-up
command prompt and type the full name of the program there. Type<strong>
</strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">the</span></strong><strong>
</strong>key combination <strong><span style="text-decoration: none">Alt
+ F2 </span></strong>to cause a pop-up run command prompt to appear
(you can enter any number of commands this way without using a menu
or a terminal window).  The command prompt will look like this: 
</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Alt-F2-Run-a-command.png" name="Image19" align="left" width="366" height="126">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
Type
into the prompt’s text box this command:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New, monospace"><b>wasta-offline</b></font></p>
<p>and initiate the command by pressing the Enter key. The
wasta-offline program should start up.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.49in"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>Note:
If you do not get a response using Method 1, Method 2 or Method 3
above, it may be that wasta-offline is not yet installed on your
computer. If this is the case you will need to install the
wasta-offline program on the local computer before you can proceed.
In most cases, the memory stick or external hard drive should have a
copy of the program on its root directory. If you find it there it
should be called something like the following:</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.49in"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i><b>wasta-offline_1.1.9.6~ubuntu16.04.1_all</b></i></font><strong><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i><b>.deb</b></i></font></strong><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>
</i></font><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>[for Wasta
16.04], or</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.49in"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i><b>wasta-offline_1.1.9.6~ubuntu14.04.1_all</b></i></font><strong><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i><b>.deb</b></i></font></strong><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>
</i></font><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>[for Wasta
14.04]</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.49in"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>You
should be able to double click on the appropriate deb file to install
wasta-offline on your system. Once you have installed wasta-offline
continue with the instructions below.</i></font></p>
<p>After typing in the command <strong>wasta-offline</strong>, you
will be prompted for the computer user's administrative password:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Enter-Password-for-wasta-offline.png" name="Image3" align="left" width="427" height="229">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Enter the computer user's administrative password for this
computer, and press OK.</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Use-wasta-offline-yes-no-dialog.png" name="Image4" align="left" width="547" height="234">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The first dialog box above, warns you that you will soon be asked
where on the system to find the update files. You should have the
memory stick or external USB drive already inserted into the USB port
on the side of your machine, so you can proceed with the <strong>Yes</strong>
button at this point. Another dialog appears:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Select-wasta-offliine-folder-dialog.png" name="Image5" align="left" width="625" height="413">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Normally the wasta-offline program will be able to find the
location of the wasta-offline folder on the memory stick or external
USB drive, and it will be automatically selected as shown in the
dialog above.</p>
<p>However, if no wasta-offline folder is automatically selected, you
need to navigate (in the left pane) to the name of the memory stick
or external hard drive that you inserted and find the folder named
<b>wasta-offline</b> (in the main window pane) and highlight it. It
is the folder which already contains the files representing all the
software updates:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p>downloaded from the Internet or server in the case of the
	1TB USB hard drive, or</p>
	<li/>
<p>transferred from an already updated source Wasta computer
	by means of wasta-offline-setup onto a memory stick 
	</p>
</ul>
<p>In the illustration above, the name of the external USB drive is
called <b>LM-UPDATES. </b><span style="font-weight: normal">It was
automatically selected</span>, and often the <b>wasta-offline</b> was
automatically be selected for you. Finish by clicking the <strong>OK</strong>
button.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="When_wasta_offline_starts_automatically"></a>
When wasta-offline starts automatically</h3>
<p>In most cases wasta-offline will start automatically within a few
seconds after the wasta-offline memory stick or external hard drive
is plugged in. The first thing you will see is an authentication
dialog:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Enter-Password-for-wasta-offline.png" name="Image6" align="left" width="544" height="292">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>After entering the password the first dialog you will see is the
<strong>wasta </strong><strong>[</strong><strong>Offline</strong><strong>]</strong>
dialog shown below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Select-Mode-wasta-offline-Only-Dialog.png" name="Image7" align="left" width="477" height="549">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>This dialog might seem redundant since there is only one button to
click here before proceeding. But on some systems with adequate
Internet access, you might want to get software updates from BOTH the
memory stick (first priority) and directly from the Internet. This
might be desired in cases where there are software updates that you
know are available over the Internet but are not available on the
memory stick or external hard drive. When wasta-offline detects that
you have Internet access this dialog will offer two selections:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p><b>OFFLINE ONLY</b> – the default mode in which
	wasta-offline gets updates from the memory stick or 1TB external USB
	hard drive mirror only – it does not try to access the Internet</p>
	<li/>
<p><b>OFFLINE AND INTERNET</b> – the optional “hybrid”
	mode in which wasta-offline will first try to get updates from the
	memory stick or 1TB external USB hard drive - if it can’t find all
	the updates (or dependencies) it needs from there, it will try to
	get any remaining data it needs from the Internet 
	</p>
</ul>
<p>So, when Internet appear to be available, the dialog will look
something like this shown below:</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Select-Mode-wasta-offline-Dialog.png" name="Image8" align="left" width="502" height="578">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Note the presence of the second option button. In order to protect
you from unintended Internet data charges, the second option is never
automatically selected. You have to deliberately select the second
choice - if including the Internet data mode is best. In some
countries the Internet is available, but the cost per Megabyte
download is rather expensive. Other countries the Internet is
relatively free to download updates. 
</p>
<p>Many remote users won't have Internet access at the time they do
their software update from a memory stick or a full external USB
mirror, so the first dialog (the one with just the OFFLINE ONLY
option) is normally what they will see. This is the typical scenario
for the remote Manus Island Language Workers within PNG.<br/>
<br/>
In
our example far above... we are simply loading all updates from a
memory stick or external USB drive, and so we simply click the <strong>OK</strong>
button.</p>
<p>After you click on the <strong>OK</strong> button, the
wasta-offline program then does some work in the background for a
short period of time (temporarily replacing the user's sources.list
file with one that points to the external USB mirror or the USB
memory stick, rather than the remote Internet repositories, and then
it inventories the updates that are available for your computer). The
background work being done (using a FULL mirror) can take a minute or
two. To let the user know that something is happening, the following
dialogs are shown temporarily as progress indicators during the
background processes:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Adding-wasta-offline-apt-mirror-repos.png" name="Image9" align="left" width="526" height="228">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The above progress indicator appears for anywhere from a few
seconds up to about 2 minutes, showing the different repositories
that are being scanned and &quot;added&quot; from the external
mirror. As soon as the scanning process is complete the following
progress indicator appears for about 6-12 seconds (with elapsed time
changing until complete):</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Wasta-Offline-updating-software-lists.png" name="Image10" align="left" width="526" height="228">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>As soon as the background work is done the progress indicators
automatically disappear and the following message is presented to the
user:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Wasta-Offline-Finished-dialog.png" name="Image11" align="left" width="628" height="392">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>At this point we are ready to do a &quot;normal&quot; software
update procedure. <strong>Important: You must leave this </strong><strong>wasta
[Offline] Ready </strong><strong>dialog &quot;open&quot; and
unfinished as you go on to the next steps.</strong> 
</p>
<p>Wasta-offline has temporarily re-arranged the expected places to
find updates on the memory stick or external hard drive, but if you
click <b>Finish</b> too early, then the system reverts back to its
original mode of looking for updates off the Internet instead.</p>
<h3 class="western">Updating your computer while Wasta-Offline is
running in background</h3>
<h4 class="western">Using Software Updater</h4>
<p>There are many ways to update software in Wasta Linux, but here we
will describe the tool called <b>Software Update</b><strong><b>r</b></strong>
which is one of the “normal” software tools to upgrade software
packages in the Ubuntu/Wasta Linux systems. Software Updater usually
looks for updates on the Internet, but while wasta-offline is running
(and the above “Ready” message is displaying), Software Updater
is temporarily directed to get its updates from the memory stick or
external hard drive that is plugged into the computer – instead of
the Internet.</p>
<p>It is possible that the Technician for your project has given out
a USB memory stick with useful updates for you to &quot;download&quot;
(really transfer) over to the Language Worker's computer. It's also
possible, that the entire Linux repository of possible software has
been given to you instead on an external hard drive. If such a
&quot;mirror&quot; of the Internet has been given, then instead of a
small memory stick, there will be a larger USB powered portable
hard-drive given. This copy or &quot;mirror&quot; of the Internet
files, could be as large as 600 Gigabytes! Quite large indeed.</p>
<p>The Software Updater program can be started by one of the three
methods that you used earlier to start  running the wasta-offline
program itself. However, there is another method that is even easier
to access, by clicking on an icon on your desktop as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Software-Updater-icon-and-menu.png" name="Image12" align="left" width="407" height="318">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Click on the <b>Software Updater</b><b> icon</b> found on the
lower right corner of the desktop. In the image above, the system is
reporting that there are 16 updates available. That number will vary
from update to update. It is the number of packages that would have
been transferred over the Internet, if you had used the Internet to
download the updates.</p>
<p><b>With wasta-offline still running </b><b>(and the “Ready”
message still open)</b>, select the <b>Show updates</b> option from
the menu that appears in the software updater’s menu (Note:
selecting the <b>Install all updates</b> menu item bypasses the next
dialog).</p>
<p>The Software Updater will start up and show any updates that are
available to install:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Software-Updater-Showing-Updates.png" name="Image20" align="left" width="461" height="344">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Note: If, if clicking on the <b>Show updates</b> menu item doesn’t
seem to result in any response, click on the tray icon again and
select the Show updates a second time. If, instead of the dialog
above, you see the following dialog appear:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Not-all-updates-can-be-installed.png" name="Image23" align="left" width="497" height="264">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>see the section later in this document called <a href="#Doing-a-Partial-Upgrade">Doing
a Partial Upgrade</a> for special procedures for this situation,
otherwise continue with the instructions below.</p>
<p>In the lower left part of the Software Updater dialog it says that
“2.7 MB will be downloaded” for this particular software update.
Occasionally, there may be many tens or hundreds of megabytes to “be
downloaded”. Since we are using wasta-offline, the amount to be
“downloaded” here will be done directly from the plugged-in
memory stick or external USB drive, rather than from the Internet.
You can well imagine how using wasta-offline can improve the speed
and eliminate the cost of such downloads, especially in areas where
Internet is slow or expensive.</p>
<p>Click on the <b>Install Now</b> button to begin the software
updates to your system. You may be asked to enter computer user's
administrative password , if it has been more than 15 minutes since
you started wasta-offline. The Software Updater first downloads the
updates from the memory stick or external USB drive:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Installing-updates-download-progress.png" name="Image21" align="left" width="487" height="165">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
And
then it applies those updates in the same operation:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Installing-updates-applying-progress.png" name="Image22" align="left" width="492" height="168">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Note: On rare occasions one of the software packages being updated
might need input from the user during the update process. For
example, the grub-pc package is known to ask for this confirmation:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Software-Updater-Configuring-grub-pc.png" name="Image48" align="left" width="470" height="215">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
Click
the <b>Forward</b> button to keep the maintainer’s version of the
update.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>When the installation process is complete Software Updater will
report that your computer is up to date:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Software-is-up-to-date.png" name="Image13" align="left" width="485" height="142">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>When the user clicks on the <strong>OK</strong> button, the Update
Manager automatically closes too, leaving the still-open
wasta-offline message box the user saw at the beginning of the update
process (and has been left open during the software updates):</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Wasta-Offline-Finished-Dismiss-with-Finished-dialog.png" name="Image14" align="left" width="586" height="316">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>If you have completed the above update process skip down to the
<a href="#Finishing-the-update-process">Finishing the update process</a>
section.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Doing-a-Partial-Upgrade"></a>Doing a
Partial Upgrade</h3>
<p>On rare occasions, upon selecting the Software Updater icon and
<b>Show updates</b> menu item, you may be informed that “Not all
updates can be installed”. The dialog you see will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Not-all-updates-can-be-installed-partial-upgrade.png" name="Image24" align="left" width="486" height="258">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>If you see this message while wasta-offline is running, the best
option is to select is the <b>Partial Upgrade</b> button, and then
continue with the upgrade process until it completes. Do not select
<b>Continue</b> as that will install some updates, but Software
Updater will keep prompting you for a Partial Upgrade in the future,
so you should just select <b>Partial Upgrade</b> at the outset and
get the upgrade done now while wasta-offline is running.</p>
<p>If you did not see the “Not all updates can be installed”
dialog shown above dialog just skip down to the <a href="#Finishing-the-update-process">Finishing
the update process</a>. 
</p>
<p>Pressing the Partial Upgrade button will start the upgrade process
which will involve interacting with a few messages and dialogs. A
partial upgrade requires you provide the computer user’s
administrative password for the action:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Enter-Password-for-partial-upgrade.png" name="Image25" align="left" width="523" height="203">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Type the password and press the <b>Authenticate</b> button. You
will see a “Distribution Upgrade” dialog that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Partial-upgrade-preparing-to-upgrade.png" name="Image26" align="left" width="348" height="242">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>which will “calculate the changes” for a few minutes, and then
you will be asked:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Partial-upgrade-start-upgrade.png" name="Image27" align="left" width="665" height="188">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The dialog summarizes what will be done. Ensure that you don’t
have any open documents or applications other than the Wasta-Offline
“Ready” message. Then click on the <b>Start Upgrade</b> button.
The upgrade may take a while, but the computer will not have to
download any of the upgraded packages from the Internet, since
wasta-offline is running and the upgraded packages will be
“downloaded” from the external hard drive. You will then see a
series of progress messages as shown below:</p>

<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>You may then be asked for permission to remove obsolete packages:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Partial-upgrade-remove-obsolete-pkgs.png" name="Image31" align="left" width="395" height="166">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Click on the <b>Remove</b> button. A progress message will appear
while the upgrade process does some cleaning up:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Partial-upgrade-cleaning-up.png" name="Image32" align="left" width="238" height="167">

</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>and finally, you should see the “Upgrade complete” message:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Partial-upgrade-upgrade-complete.png" name="Image33" align="left" width="334" height="162">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>At this point the partial upgrade is now complete. Click the <b>Close</b>
button shown above.</p>
<p>The “<b>Ready</b>” message of the Wasta-Offline program that
you saw earlier should still be showing on your screen. If you want
to install new software keep reading the section below. If you are
finished updating your computer, skip down to the <a href="#Finishing-the-update-process">Finishing
the update process</a> section.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Installing_new_software"></a>Installing
new software</h3>
<p>While the Full Wasta-Offline Mirror can be used to <b>update
existing software</b> on your computer, it is also possible to use
the full mirror to <b>install new software</b> from the inventory of
over 55,000 Linux software packages that already exist in the 600GB
of data contained on the Full Wasta-Offline Mirror – all without
accessing the Internet! If you do not wish to install any new
software just skip down to the <a href="#Finishing-the-update-process">Finishing
the update process</a> section.</p>
<p>If you wish to install a new program – while Wasta-Offline is
running and its “Ready” message is displaying on your desktop -
you can do so with a program called <b>Synaptic Package Manager</b>.
This package manager can be started from the same pop up menu you
used earlier:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Software-update-menu-Start-package-manager.png" name="Image35" align="left" width="299" height="271">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Click on the Software Updater icon on the task bar and select the
<b>Start package manager </b>item from the pop up menu as shown
above. Installing software requires administration privileges, so you
will need to computer user's administrative password for this
computer:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Enter-Password-for-Synaptic-Package-Manager.png" name="Image36" align="left" width="641" height="226">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Enter the password and click on <b>Authenticate</b>.</p>
<p>The Synaptic Package Manager runs and displays its main screen as
follows:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Synaptic-package-manager-main-screen.png" name="Image37" align="left" width="665" height="378">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The Synaptic Package Manger has a lot of features that we won’t
describe here. We’ll simply show how to search for and install a
new software program that doesn’t come pre-installed in Wasta
Linux. You can scroll down through all 55,000 + packages to see
what’s there, but if you know what a program is called, it is much
quicker to search for it using the Search button shown above. 
</p>
<p>Click on the <b>Search</b> button as shown above. In the Search
box, type the name <b>tuxmath</b> which is a math game for children
that we’ll use as an example to install:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Synaptic-package-manager-search-box.png" name="Image38" align="left" width="295" height="146">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Click on the <b>Search</b> button of this Search dialog. The
program will search its inventory of programs, and will show you its
search results in the main program window as follows:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Synaptic-package-manager-search-results-tuxmath.png" name="Image39" align="left" width="665" height="378">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
A
short description of the highlighted package is given in the right
column along with its version numbers. Hint: you can often find more
detailed information about Linux programs using Google or other
search engine on the Internet. If you want to install tuxmath and try
it out (you can easily remove it later with this same Synaptic
Package Manager), <b>click on the empty check box</b> at the left of
the package name tuxmath where you will see a pop up menu like this:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Synaptic-package-manager-tuxmath-Mark-for-installation.png" name="Image40" align="left" width="610" height="347">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>If the program you want to install, has additional dependencies
that it needs, you will see a dialog that lists those additional
changes, and asks you to confirm you want to proceed:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Synaptic-package-manager-tuxmath-Mark-additional-changes.png" name="Image41" align="left" width="350" height="287">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Go ahead and click the <b>Mark</b> button. 
</p>
<p>The display will then show the program (tuxmath) and any of its
dependencies marked with ticks in their check boxes as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Synaptic-package-manager-tuxmath-Marked-Apply-for-installation.png" name="Image42" align="left" width="596" height="339">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
At
this point you could Search for other programs you want to install
and mark them with ticks in their check boxes – as you have done
with the tuxmath program. With the program(s) you want to install
“marked”, click on the <b>Apply</b> button in the tool bar as
shown above.</p>
<p>The package manager asks you to confirm your choice(s) of
packages/programs to be installed as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Synaptic-package-manager-tuxmath-confirm-apply-changes-for-installation.png" name="Image43" align="left" width="506" height="281">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Finally, click on the <b>Apply</b> button. The program proceeds to
download, and install the program showing the following progress
dialogs:</p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
	<col width="128*">

	</tr>

<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Using wasta-offline the downloading happens very quickly and
installation is fast. When the process is complete you will see the
following message:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Synaptic-package-manager-changes-applied.png" name="Image46" align="left" width="386" height="163">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Click on the <b>Close</b> button. The package manager will show
the installed program(s) now with a solid green filled check boxes –
the same marking that it shows for all other installed programs on
your computer:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Synaptic-package-manager-tuxmath-showing-installed-green-checkboxes.png" name="Image34" align="left" width="665" height="378">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>If you are finished installing software you can close the Synaptic
Package Manager window.</p>
<p>Tux Math is an entertaining math game featuring Tux - the Linux
penguin mascot. Once Tux Math is installed you can find it and run it
from the main Wasta Menu in the <b>Education</b> category. 
</p>
<p>There are other interesting “Tux” games including Tux Type (a
typing tutor), Tux Football (soccer), Tux Paint, etc. Just Search for
“tux” in the package manager’s Search box. 
</p>
<p>Continue with the section below to end the wasta-offline session.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Finishing-the-update-process"></a>Finishing

<p>The wasta-offline “Ready” message should still be displaying

<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>You should now, click the <strong>Finish</strong> button to
formally end the Wasta-Offline session and close the “Ready” 
message.</p>
<p>At this point the system has returned back to &quot;normal&quot;
and will look for updates, as before, by using the Internet. If the
system were somehow brought to a town and connected, then it would be
ready to receive downloads and updates via the Internet. 
</p>
<p>Since you have just completed the update process, you can now
&quot;Safely Remove&quot; the external USB hard drive mirror or the
USB memory stick. Hover the mouse over the icons found on the lower
