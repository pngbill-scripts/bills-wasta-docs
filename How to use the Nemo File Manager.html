<h1 class="western" align="center">How to use the Nemo File
Manager<br/>
by Bill Martin (revised <sdfield type=DOCINFO subtype=CHANGE format=DATE sdnum="1033;1033;D. MMMM YYYY">8. October 2017</sdfield>)</h1>
<h3 class="western">What is this document?</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Wasta-logo-low-res.jpg" name="Image55" align="left" width="331" height="71" border="0"/>
This
document is an illustrated guide that shows how to use the Nemo File
Manager to view, edit, copy, and delete the <b>files</b> and <b>folders</b>
on your Wasta Linux computer.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Who is this document for?</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">This document is designed to be a guide
for all Wasta Linux users whether they are new users or experienced
users. Everyone who uses a computer at some point will need to make
use of a File Manager. 
</p>
<h3 class="western">When does it make sense to use this procedure</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">It makes sense:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">When you want to find or view
	certain files and folders on your computer's</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">When you want to organize your
	files or folders by copying or moving them into folders that you
	create and organize</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">When you want to copy files or
	folders to and from an external memory stick or hard drive</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">When you want to delete files or
	folders, or perhaps recover previously deleted files or folders</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">When you want to display the
	contents of documents, pictures or video files</p>
</ul>
<h3 class="western">What is a File Manager?</h3>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The File Manager is a
computer program. The File Manager give you a view of what is inside
your computer. With the File Manager you can access and explore your
computer's folders and files. You can view, edit, copy, rename, and
delete the <span style="font-weight: normal">files</span> and <span style="font-weight: normal">folders</span>
on your Wasta Linux computer. Since the File Manager gives you the
power to create and destroy files and folders, it is important that
you know how to properly use it. The File Manager that comes with
Wasta Linux is called “Nemo” but in this document we will refer
to it simply as the <b>File Manager</b>. 
</p>
<h3 class="western">Launching the File Manager</h3>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The File Manager can be
started or launched from:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The panel’s Files
	launch bar icon</p>
	<li/>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The main Menu’s
	Accessories category</p>
	<li/>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The main Menu’s
	Places category</p>
</ul>
<h4 class="western"><a name="Starting the File Manager from the panel launch bar"></a>
Starting the File Manager from the panel’s launch bar</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Hover your mouse pointer
over the icons in the launch bar located in the lower left part of
your screen. When you hold your mouse pointer over the folder icon in
the launch bar it says, &quot;Files&quot; and appears as a folder
icon like this: 
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

<p align="left"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Tray-Icon-highlighted.png" name="Image1" align="left" width="296" height="109">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left">Click once on this &quot;<b>Files</b>&quot; launch
bar item to run the File Manager program. 
</p>
<h4 class="western">Starting the File Manager from the main Menu’s
Accessories</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Another way to start the
File Manager is to click on the main <b>Menu</b>, then on the
<b>Accessories</b> category, and select the <b>Files</b> item to run
the File Manager program as shown below:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Menu-Accessories-Files.png" name="Image6" align="left" width="446" height="387">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<h4 class="western">Starting the File Manager from one of the main
Menu’s Places</h4>
<p align="left">A third way to start the File Manager is to select
one of the main Menu’s Places as shown in the illustration below:</p>
<p align="left"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Menu-Places-Starts-Nemo.png" name="Image5" align="left" width="486" height="415">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left">Selecting any one of the locations in the main Menu’s
Places category (<b>Documents</b>, <b>Music</b>, <b>Pictures</b>,
<b>Videos</b>, <b>Downloads</b>) will automatically start up the File
Manager, and when it is started this way, the contents of that
particular place will be displayed in the File Manager’s contents
window. 
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">After it starts, the File
Manager program appears as shown in the following illustration:</p>
<p align="left"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Nemo-default-view-Home-dir.png" name="Image2" align="left" width="561" height="299">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left">Note that the File Manager window has a number of
important parts. At left is the <b>Sidebar</b> which lists the main
locations that are on, or attached to your computer. When one of
those locations is highlighted, the <b>Contents Window</b> will
display what is at that location. When File Manager starts up, it
always displays the files and folders contained in the user’s <b>Home</b>
area in the contents window. There is a <b>Menubar</b> near the top
left, and a <b>Navigation bar</b> under the Menubar. There are
different &quot;views&quot; of the information in the Sidebar and
also different &quot;views&quot; of the items in the Contents Window
- we will explain more about those views and the other parts of the
File Manager later below.</p>
<p align="left">The File Manager is an important tool. The more you
become familiar with it and develop skill in using it, the more you
will be able to make the best use of your computer. This document is
designed to help you gain mastery in the use of the File Manager.</p>
<h3 class="western">Clicking, Selecting, Highlighting</h3>
<p>[to be written] Include Edit : Select All, Select Items
Matching...</p>
<h3 class="western">Files, Folders and Directories</h3>
<h4 class="western">Files</h4>
<p align="left"><img src="wasta-docs-images/File-icon-for-a-test-document.png" name="Image9" align="left" width="136" height="72" border="0"/>
In
computer talk, a <b>file</b> is an object on a computer that stores a
document, or a picture image, or a video, or some other kind of data.
For example, a document created by the LibreOffice Writer program and
saved in a file with the name ‘Text Document’ would look like the
image at left within the File Manager. 
</p>
<p align="left">A computer file is usually associated with a
particular kind of computer program that can create or open the file.
The name of many files may have a dot followed by an abbreviation
called an “extension” that designates the kind of data the file
contains, or what program created the file. The name under the icon
above has the extension <b>.odt</b> which indicates that the file
contains data for a document that was created using the LibreOffice
Writer program. The .odt extension is an abbreviation for “<b>O</b>pen
<b>D</b>ocument <b>T</b>ext”.</p>
<h4 class="western">Folders and Directories</h4>
<p align="left"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Folder-icon-for-documents.png" name="Image8" align="left" width="91" height="71" border="0"/>
In
computer talk, <b>f</b><b>olders and directories are essentially the
same thing</b>. In this document, we will always use the word
‘<b>folder</b>’ to refer to a special type of file that serves as
a <b>container</b> for other files and folders. Within the File
Manager program, folders are shown with an icon of a folder, and
display the name of the folder below the folder, as shown at left. 
</p>
<p align="left">Folders can contain many other folders or files. When
a folder contains other folders, we could refer to the enclosing
folder as a “parent folder” and any folders within it as “child
folders.” Within a particular folder, every file and folder must
have a unique name. That is, no two files or folders can have the
same name within a given folder. A file of the same name can exist in
a different folder, however. Folders make it possible to organize the
files on your computer in a logical way that makes sense to you. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Note: The example icons and names shown
above assume that File Manager is set to its default view, called
“<a href="#Icon View">Icon View</a>”. There are other views,
including a “<a href="#List View">List View</a>” that can be used
within the File Manager. More information about File Manager’s
<a href="#Different Views of File Manager's Data">different views are
</a><a href="#Different Views of File Manager's Data">discussed
later</a>. 
</p>
<h3 class="western">The Home folder</h3>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Nemo-Home-folder.png" name="Image3" align="left" width="101" height="30" border="0"/>

The top-level folder on your computer is your <b>Home </b>folder.
Within File Manager, it is represented as an icon and the name &quot;Home&quot;
that looks like the image shown here and in the File Manager image
above. The Home folder is listed as the first item in the Sidebar on
the left side of the File Manager. All of your computer's other
folders and files are contained in your Home folder. When you
highlight the Home folder by clicking the mouse pointer on it, the
contents of your Home folder are shown in the right hand Contents
Window of the File Manager.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The File Manager displays
the name of the <b>user</b> in its Navigation bar alongside the home
icon when the Home item is selected in the Sidebar:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Home-User-Name-bill.png" name="Image7" align="left" width="615" height="98">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">In the above illustration
my user name ‘bill’ is shown to the right of the home folder
icon. Your user name should be shown when the File Manager is
highlighting your Home folder. Each user of your computer (if it has
been set up for multiple users) has a unique user name. 
</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Default folders"></a>The Default folders</h3>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Within your Home folder
there are several folders already provided for you as &quot;default&quot;
folders. These are listed under your Home folder within the File
Manager’s Sidebar like this:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Nemo-Home-Default-folders.png" name="Image4" align="left" width="114" height="125">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The default folders
include the following: <b>Desktop</b>, <b>Documents</b>, <b>Music</b>,
<b>Pictures</b>, <b>Videos</b> and <b>Downloads</b>. Each has a small
icon or picture to the left of the name of the folder. These default
folders correspond to the default list of places shown in the main
Menu’s Places category.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">You will notice that these
default folders are also shown in the right side of the File Manager
(the contents window) when you highlight your <b>Home</b> folder in
the Sidebar.</p>
<h3 class="western">Folders that are automatically created by
software programs</h3>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition to the default
folders, your Home folder may also contain some other folders created
automatically by some of the programs you use. 
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Folder-icon-for-Adapt-It-Unicode-Work.png" name="Image10" align="left" width="138" height="93" border="0"/>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left">For example, the Adapt It program creates a folder
called <b>Adapt It Unicode Work</b> which looks like the illustration
at left. This folder is created by the Adapt It program. It is the
main location where Adapt It stores its projects, adapted texts,
exported documents and settings. You should <b>never</b> use the File
Manager to move or change the names of this folder or other any other
folder or files that Adapt It creates within the Adapt It Unicode
Work folder. Adapt It will manage all the file and child folders that
are located in this folder.</p>

projects, texts, and settings. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Therefore</span><span style="font-weight: normal">,
it</span> is important that you <b>not</b> move or make changes to
these folders. 
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>WARNING: If you move or

<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">You can use the File

</p>
<h4 class="western">Knowing where you are looking in the file system</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Many people are familiar
with file cabinets. If you are looking in the drawer of a physical
file cabinet, you might see a view of what’s contained in a part of
that file cabinet’s storage area:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Physical-File-Cabinet-2-drawer.png" name="Image39" align="left" width="128" height="205">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Similarly, if you are
looking at File Manager on your computer’s screen, you might see a
view of what’s contained in a particular storage area of your
computer. Consider the following illustration:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Physical-Files-vs-File-Manager.png" name="Image16" align="left" width="665" height="310">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
The
image at left shows the drawer of a physical file cabinet called
“Work Reports” which contains separate folders for the years
2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The image at right shows File
Manager’s view of a folder called “Work Reports” which also
contains separate folders for the years 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and
2013.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Working with a physical
file cabinet, it is fairly easy to open the cabinet drawer and look
inside. With the drawer open you can see what folders are in the
cabinet, pull out a particular folder, open it and look through the
individual papers within the folder, then close the folder and
physically put the folder back into the file cabinet and close the
drawer. The File Manager, however, cannot show you a physical cabinet
that you can open and explore in depth and manipulate its contents
with your bare hands. Instead, <b>File Manager shows you an image on
a flat screen, which only represents in a graphical way what the
computer has in its invisible memory</b>. Within File Manager you can
select a particular folder electronically, open it and look through
the individual files or folders within the folder, then
electronically close the folder and the File Manager. With a File
Manager, it may be a little more difficult to perceive “where you
are looking” in the file system, since the screen image is flat and
you don’t as easily see the “big picture” that you see when you
are looking into a physical file drawer. If he folder you have opened
is empty, the contents window will also be empty.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The <b>File Manager’s
Navigation bar</b> is a simple way of showing you <b>where you are
looking</b> in the computer’s file system. Here is a larger image
of the Navigation bar from the above File Manager image:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Navigation-bar-showing-path-to-Work-Reports.png" name="Image17" align="left" width="590" height="49">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">We will describe the use
of the parts at the left end of the Navigation bar later. The
important thing to understand here is how the Navigation bar helps
you to <b>know where you are looking</b> in the computer’s file
system. In the image above, pay special attention to the <b>names</b>
shown in the right part of the Navigation bar (shown in the above
illustration in the red box). The names in the bar show the <b>path</b>
that I have taken to get to where I am currently looking. <b>The path
shows the locations from the left and proceed to the right.</b> The
left end is the starting location and the highlighted item at the
right end is where I am currently looking in the file system. The
highlighted item in the image above is the <b>Work Reports</b>
folder, so that is the location where I am currently looking. The
File Manager’s <b>contents window</b> shows me the actual contents
– which may be files or folders or a mixture of both - of the Work
Reports folder. The whole path (moving left to right) shows that I
went from my <b>bill</b> user’s Home folder through the <b>Documents</b>
folder and to the <b>Work Reports</b> folder to get where I am. So,
then, if you are not sure what you are looking at within the File
Manager, just look at the Navigation bar. <b>The </b><b>light-blue
</b><b>highlighted location of the bar is “where you are”</b>.  
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">With a little effort, you
could keep a physical file cabinet and its contents of files and
folders well organized by writing good names on the folder’s tabs,
and by ordering the folders in a logical way within the file cabinet.
Similarly, with a little effort within File Manager, you can keep
your computer’s folders and files well organized, with good names
on its folder icons, and a logical ordering of the folders within the
file system.

<h4 class="western">Using the Navigation bar</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">As illustrated above, the
Navigation bar shows you the location or path of the folders and
files you are viewing in the contents window. The Navigation bar also
allows you to quickly navigate to other locations in the computer’s
file system.</p>
<h5 class="western">Go to the previous visited location button</h5>
<p>When you use the File Manager to open folders (as shown above in
the “Knowing where you are looking...” section), you have
navigated along a certain path or locations to get where you are
currently looking. You may wish to “go back” to one of those
previous locations along the path:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Navigation-bar-previous-visited-location-button.png" name="Image18" align="left" width="431" height="39">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The button at the left end of the Navigation bar (shown as a  <b>&lt;</b>
 in the red box above) is the “<b>Go to the previous visited
location</b>” button. If you have visited several locations or
folders pressing this button repeatedly will take you back through
those previous locations. In the above illustration pressing this
button once, File Manager will go back one step to the <b>left</b> in
the path to the previously opened folder which was the <b>Documents</b>
folder:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Navigation-bar-showing-path-to-previously-visited-Documents.png" name="Image19" align="left" width="665" height="307">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h5 class="western">Go to the next visited location</h5>
<p>Note that once we have navigated to a “previous” location, the
next navigation button (the  <b>&gt;</b>  button in the bar) is now
enabled. This button (in the red box of the illustration below) is
the “<b>Go to the next visited location</b>” button:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Navigation-bar-Next-visited-location-button.png" name="Image20" align="left" width="534" height="45">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Now a click on this  <b>&gt;</b>  button would navigate one step
back to the <b>right</b> in the path shown in the navigation bar. The
actions of these first two buttons on the Navigation bar is very
similar to the actions of the navigation buttons on most Internet web
browsers, which allow you to “Go back one page” and “Go forward
one page” of web sites that you have visited.</p>
<h5 class="western">Child folders and parent folders</h5>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">As mentioned earlier, one
folder may contain contain one or more folders within it – and
those contained folders may also contain more folders within them.
You can think of folder like generations of families. A folder may
contain one or more &quot;child&quot; folders. The folder that
contains the child folders is called the &quot;parent&quot; folder.
Child folders may also contain more child folders (grand-children),
and so on. Any folder may also contain other kinds of files along
with &quot;child&quot; folders.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The “child” and
“parent” relationships are relative to what “generation” we
are looking at. Whenever you use the File Manager to open a folder
(using one of the methods of opening folders described in <a href="#Opening folders">Opening
folders</a> section above), you change your view of the contents from
a “parent” folder to what was the “child” folder. Once
opened, the “child” folder becomes the new “parent” folder in
the contents view, and any additional folders that are contained in
that folder are now child folders – in relation to the view you
have in the File Manager.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The File Manager has a
navigation button (the <b>up</b> arrow in the red box of the
illustration below) that can be used to “<b>Go to parent folder</b>”:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Navigation-bar-parent-folder-location-button.png" name="Image21" align="left" width="534" height="45">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The “Go to parent
folder” button shown above can be used within the File Manager to
go “up” one generation and open the contents of the location
which is the “parent”. In the above illustration we know we are
currently looking at the contents of the Documents folder – because
it is highlighted in blue on the Navigation bar. If we now click <b>once</b>
on the “<b>up</b>” navigation button, The contents view will
switch to viewing the contents of the parent of the Documents folder
– which is user <b>bill’s Home</b> folder:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Navigation-bar-showing-path-to-parent-bill-Home.png" name="Image22" align="left" width="665" height="295">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<h5 class="western">Direct click on a folder shown in the Navigation
bar’s path</h5>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"> After you have navigated
around in child and parent folders, you may want to directly look at
the contents of one of the folders again that is shown on that path.
For example, you may have viewed the contents of the Documents and
Work Reports folders, and then navigated back up “two generations”
to your Home folder. The path on the Navigation bar might then look
like the following illustration:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Navigation-bar-direct-click-to-path-location.png" name="Image23" align="left" width="665" height="120">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">When previously visited
folders are still showing on the Navigation bar’s path, you can
simply click directly on the name of a folder on that path to
immediately open again that folder and view its contents. So, in the
above illustration we are currently viewing the contents of bill’s
Home folder, but we could click on the Work Reports name on the bar’s
path to open it again, or we could click on the Documents name on the
bar’s path to open it again. The path shown on the File Manager’s
Navigation bar will show previously opened folders in your navigated
path, but only until the File Manager program is closed. Each time
File Manager is started up afresh it will not any path that you
navigated in a previous session of File Manager.</p>
<h5 class="western">Reload the current location</h5>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">There is another button on
the Navigation bar that has an arrow going in a circle (see the
illustration in the red box below), that can be used to have the File
Manager to “Reload the current location”:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Navigation-bar-Reload-current-location-button.png" name="Image24" align="left" width="665" height="37">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">You can click the “reload”
button if you think the contents view is not up-to-date in what it is
showing. This situation might only happen if another program suddenly
changes the contents of the folder while you are viewing it in the
File Manager. That is not likely to happen, so you would rarely need
to use this button, but it is there in case it is needed.</p>
<h4 class="western">Summary of File Manager’s navigation buttons
for use in folder navigation</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Look again at the left end
of the Navigation bar. By hovering the mouse pointer over the
navigation buttons there you can see a momentary “tool tip” that
tells you what each button is used for. Here is a summary chart of
what those navigation buttons do if you click on them:</p>

<h4 class="western">Always “safely remove” the memory stick or
external drive</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">While a memory stick is
connected to your Wasta computer you will see it listed under <b>Devices</b>
in the Sidebar similar to the following illustration:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Nemo-Devices-USB_BACKUP.png" name="Image36" align="left" width="191" height="46">

<p align="left"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Nemo-Devices-unmount-button.png" name="Image37" align="left" width="32" height="28">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
In
the image shown above, the device that is plugged in is named
&quot;USB_BACKUP&quot;. Your memory stick will probably have a
different name/label. When you have finished using the memory stick
(or an external USB drive), you should take special action to “<b>safely
remove it</b>” before physically pulling it out of your computer.
Note the <b>small round icon</b> that is located to the right of the
device name in the red box of the above image. Here is a larger view:
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left">Within the File Manager, this icon appears at the
right side of a plugged in device to indicate that the device is
“mounted” in the file system of the computer. It also functions
as the &quot;Safely Remove&quot; button. <b>Before unplugging any USB
device that stores information, you should always click on this
&quot;Safely Remove button. </b>
</p>
<p align="left"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left">When that little <b>small round icon</b> disappears
after clicking on it, you know it is safe to remove the USB device.
You may also see a message on your screen that says:</p>
<p align="left"><img src="wasta-docs-images/You-can-now-unplug-LM-UPDATES.png" name="Image40" align="left" width="403" height="40">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left">If the computer is busy copying data from, or writing
data to the device, it will tell you it is <b>busy</b> – you should
wait until it is finished:</p>
<p align="left"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Volume-is-busy.png" name="Image41" align="left" width="295" height="141">

</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left">If you see this <b>Volume is busy</b> notice, <b>wait
a reasonable amount of time</b> for any copying actions to complete. 
<b>If you have opened a file on the USB drive within another program,
you should first close it from within that other program</b>, then
attempt to do the “safely remove” action again. If the <b>Volume
is busy</b> notice keeps appearing - even after doing these things -
you can click on the <b>Unmount Anyway</b> button. If you have to
click on the <b>Unmount Anyway</b> button, you should check to see it
any copy operation that you started completed successfully.</p>
<h3 class="western">Copying folders or files</h3>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">There are times when you
may want to copy folders or files to a different location on your
computer, to an external USB flash drive, or to another computer.</p>
<h4 class="western">Summary Steps – Copying folders or files</h4>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Open the File
	Manager (“Files”) and navigate to the<span style="font-weight: normal">
	folder</span><span style="font-weight: normal"> or file that you
	want to copy</span>.  
	</p>
	<li/>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Click once on the
	name of the “source” folder or file you want to copy - to
	highlight it.</p>
	<li/>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Do one of the
	following <b>Copy actions</b> - to place a copy of the source folder
	or file in the computer’s memory (clipboard):<br/>
* Click on the
	File Manager's “<b>Edit</b><span style="font-weight: normal">”</span>
	menu, and select the “<b>Copy</b><span style="font-weight: normal">”</span>
	menu item, or<br/>
* <b>Right-click</b> on the selected folder or
	file, and select the “<b>Copy</b>” menu item, or<br/>
* Hold
	down the <b>Ctrl</b> key and press the <b>C</b> key (<b>Ctrl+C</b>
	keyboard shortcut).</p>
	<li/>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Plug in the USB
	device - if the copy is to be made to that device.</p>
	<li/>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Navigate to the
	destination folder or device that is to receive the copy. If it is a
	folder select it and press Enter to open the folder. If it is a
	device, select the device in the Devices group of the File Manager,
	and navigate to an appropriate destination folder on that device,
	select the destination folder and press Enter to open it (or, you
	can <a href="#Creating a new folder">create a new </a><a href="#Creating a new folder">destination
	</a><a href="#Creating a new folder">folder</a> on that device if
	needed - see <a href="#Creating a new folder">below</a>).</p>
	<li/>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Do one of the
	following <b>Paste actions</b> - to paste the source file or folder
	from the computer’s memory (clipboard) to the destination
	location:<br/>
* Click on the File Manager’s “<b>Edit</b>”
	menu, and select the “<b>Paste</b><span style="font-weight: normal">”</span>
	menu item, or<br/>
* <b>Right-click</b> on an <b>empty part of the
	</b><b>destination folder’s </b><b>contents window</b>, and select
	the “Paste” menu item, or<br/>
* Hold down the <b>Ctrl</b> key
	and press the <b>V</b> key (<b>Ctrl+</b><b>V</b> keyboard shortcut).</p>
	<li/>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The folder or file
	will be pasted (copied) into the destination folder. Since you have
	done a copy operation the folder or file will now exist in both its
	original location and in the destination location. 
	</p>
</ol>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Notes</b>: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">For many common
	computer procedures, there are many different ways to do the same
	thing. Steps 3 and 6 above illustrate this general principle: <b>You
	can often use a program menu command, a right-click menu command, or
	a keyboard shortcut, to do the same thing</b>. As you gain skill,
	you can decide which way works best for you.</p>
	<li/>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">There are other
	ways to copy folders or files (involving dragging with a mouse while
	holding down a special key), but those techniques are more
	dangerous, so they will not be described in this document.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Then we navigate to the destination
where we want the copy to go. In this case we want the copy to be
made to an <b>empty folder</b> which is also named “<b>Work

the memory stick called “KINGSTON”. It appears in the Devices
list:</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, with the File Manager’s contents

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, to transfer a copy of the

<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Plug the memory stick containing

<h4 class="western">Illustrated Steps - Creating, renaming, deleting
or moving folders (and files)</h4>
<p>To illustrate the procedures that were summarized above, we will
navigate to an existing folder called <b>Work Reports</b>, and open
that folder. Within the Work Reports folder we will <b>create</b> a
new folder called <b>2019</b> and another accidentally created folder
called <b>Untitled Folder</b>. Within the Work Reports folder we will
also create a Writer document called <b>January 2019 Work Report.</b><b>odt</b>.
To correct our dates, we will <b>rename</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
the </span><b>2019 </b><span style="font-weight: normal">folder to
</span><b>2018</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> </span><span style="font-weight: normal">and
</span><b>rename</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> the </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Writer</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
document to </span><b>January 2018 Work Report.</b><b>odt.</b> Then,
to clean up our Work Reports folder, we will <b>delete</b> the
accidentally created folder called <b>Untitled Folder</b>. Finally,
we realize that the <b>January 2018 Work Report.</b><b>odt</b>
document should be located inside the <b>2018</b> folder, so we move
the <b>January 2018 Work Report.</b><b>odt</b> document into that
<b>2018</b> folder.</p>
<p>We run File Manager and we click on <b>Documents</b> in the
<b>Sidebar</b> to show the contents of the Documents folder. We
highlight the <b>Work Reports</b> folder and press <b>Enter</b> to
open it. File Manager now shows the various child folders named for
the years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 as shown in the
illustration below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-illustration-showing-WorkReports-year-folders.png" name="Image48" align="left" width="613" height="316">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>For illustration purposes we want to <b>create</b> a new folder
called <b>2019</b> and another accidentally created folder called
<b>Untitled Folder</b>. With the <b>Work Reports</b> folder open we
click on the File Manager's “<b>File</b><span style="font-weight: normal">”</span>
menu, and select the “<b>Create New Folder</b><span style="font-weight: normal">”</span>
menu item as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-illustration-File-Create-New-Folder-Menu.png" name="Image49" align="left" width="614" height="316">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal">(Alternatively, you can </span><span style="font-weight: normal">use</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
</span><b>Right-click+Create New Folder</b><span style="font-weight: normal">,
or the </span><b>Shift+Ctrl+N</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
shortcut key).</span></p>
<p>The File Manager makes a new folder icon and provides the name
Untitled Folder as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-illustration-File-Create-New-Folder-Unknown-Folder.png" name="Image50" align="left" width="649" height="336">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>I accidentally click outside the new folder’s edit box. Since I
didn’t immediately change the name, the name of the new folder
becomes Untitled Folder. Later I’ll delete that accidentally
created folder, but before I do that I click again on the File
Manager's “<b>File</b><span style="font-weight: normal">”</span>
menu, and select the “<b>Create New Folder</b><span style="font-weight: normal">”</span>
menu item. (or use Right-click+Create New Folder, or Shift-Ctrl+N).
This time I immediately type the new name <b>2019</b> into the edit
box under the folder as shown in the illustration below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-illustration-File-Create-New-Folder-2019.png" name="Image51" align="left" width="645" height="333">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>And I end my edit of the name by pressing the <b>Enter</b> key.
The File Manager now shows the contents with the folders sorted
alphabetically with the new <b>2019</b> folder I just created
highlighted, and the accidentally created folder called <b>Untitled
Folder</b> there, as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-illustration-File-Create-New-Folder-2019-sorted-selected.png" name="Image52" align="left" width="650" height="334">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>I am in a bit of a hurry, so I decide to go ahead and create a new
Writer document for my January work report, and save that report into
the Work Reports folder naming it <b>January 2019</b><b> </b><b>Work
Report.odt</b>. I won’t illustrate the work done in Writer here,
but after that file was created and saved within Writer, the File
Manager shows that the contents of the Work Reports folder now look
like this:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-illustration-showing-WorkReports-year-folders-disorganized.png" name="Image53" align="left" width="633" height="326">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Looking at the contents of my Work Reports folder above, I realize
that in my haste I’ve created a bit of an organizational mess. For
some reason I thought of the year as 2019 instead of 2018, so I
incorrectly named the new folder 2019 when <b>it should have been
named</b><b> 2018</b>. I also still have the accidentally created
Untitled Folder there that serves no useful purpose. Moreover, I got
the date of the Writer document wrong too. <b>It should have been
named January 2018 Work Report.odt</b>. Finally, that work report
document for January was saved in the overall Work Reports folder. It
should have been saved from Writer directly into the folder that
should have been named 2018. What to do?</p>
<h5 class="western">Cleaning up and organizing folders and files with
File Manager</h5>
<p>First, let’s <b>rename</b> the folder <b>2019</b> to <b>2018</b>.
Click on the 2019 folder to highlight it, then Click on File
Manager’s <b>Edit</b> menu and select <b>Rename…</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">(Alternat</span><span style="font-weight: normal">iv</span><span style="font-weight: normal">ely,
you can use </span><b>Right-click+Rename…</b><span style="font-weight: normal">,
or the </span><b>F2</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> shortcut
key).</span> Rename the 2019 folder to <b>2018</b> as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-illustration-File-Rename-Folder-to-2018.png" name="Image54" align="left" width="533" height="274">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Then press the <b>Enter</b> key to complete the rename process.
Next we can do the same <b>rename</b> process for the January 2019
Work Report.odt file renaming it to January 2018 Work Report.odt
shown below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-illustration-File-Rename-Writer-Doc-to-2018.png" name="Image56" align="left" width="536" height="276">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Next, we will <b>delete</b> the accidentally created folder called
<b>Untitled Folder</b>. Click on the <b>Untitled Folder</b> to
highlight it. Then click on File Manager’s <b>Edit</b> menu and
select <b>Move to Trash</b>. (Alternatively, you can use
<b>Right-click+Move to Trash</b>, or the <b>Delete</b> key). The
useless Untitled Folder disappears from the contents window which now
looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-illustration-Untitled-Folder-gone-to-Trash.png" name="Image57" align="left" width="629" height="325">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Things are looking better. The last thing we need to do is to <b>move
the Writer document January 2018 Work Report.odt into the 2018 folder
where it belongs</b>. First, we click on the January 2018 Work
Report.odt file to highlight it as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-illustration-selected-Writer-Doc-for-moving.png" name="Image58" align="left" width="638" height="328">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>With the Writer document highlighted, click on File Manager’s
<b>Edit</b> menu and select <b>Cut</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">as shown below:</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-illustration-Edit-Cut-Writer-Doc-for-moving.png" name="Image59" align="left" width="665" height="322">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal">(Alternatively, you can </span><span style="font-weight: normal">use</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
</span><b>Right-click+Cut</b><span style="font-weight: normal">, or
the </span><b>Ctrl+X</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> shortcut
key).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal">You</span> don’t see anything
happen immediately, except that the status line at the bottom of File
Manager now says: <i><b>“January 2018 Work Report.odt” will be
moved if you select the Paste command</b></i> indicating that File
Manager is now waiting for us to do the “Paste” part of the move
operation. 
</p>
<p>Next we navigate to the desired destination for the other part of
the move operation. Our destination is the folder named <b>2018</b>.
Click on the <b>2018</b> folder in the contents window to highlight
it, and press the <b>Enter</b> key (or double-click it) to open it.
The File Manager should appear like this illustration:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-illustration-opened-2018-folder-for-pasting-Writer-Doc.png" name="Image60" align="left" width="648" height="316">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The folder is currently empty so nothing appears in the content
window. But, we note that the path in the Navigation bar confirms
that we are looking in the folder named 2018. This is where we want
to “paste” the document we are moving. Click on File Manager’s
<b>Edit</b> menu and select <b>Paste:</b></p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-illustration-Edit-Paste-Writer-Doc-for-moving.png" name="Image61" align="left" width="665" height="325">

</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>(Alternatively, you can use <b>Right-click+Paste</b>, or the
<b>Ctrl+V</b> shortcut key).</p>
<p>Now click on the <b>Work Reports</b> part of the path in the
Navigation bar, to go immediately to that folder. We now see that our
Work Reports folder is nicely organized:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-illustration-showing-WorkReports-year-folders-now-organized.png" name="Image62" align="left" width="665" height="325">

<h3 class="western">How to Undo accidental changes made in File
Manager</h3>
<h4 class="western"><a name="If you accidentally Delete a file or folder"></a>
If you accidentally Delete a file or folder</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">If you accidentally Delete
or Move a folder, or a file, and you realize it right after you did
it, you should immediately select <b>Undo</b> ... in the File
Manager's <b>Edit</b> menu (or use the <b>Ctrl+Z</b> shortcut) to
<b>Undo</b> any accidental changes. For example, if you accidentally
<b>deleted</b> a file or a folder, you can click on <b>Undo Trash</b>
on the <b>Edit</b> menu: 
</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Nemo-Edit-Undo-Trash.png" name="Image12" align="left" width="579" height="229">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">If it has been some time
since you accidentally deleted a file or a folder, the <b>Undo…</b>
option may no longer be available on the File Manager’s Edit menu.
All is not lost, however. When files or folders are deleted on your
Linux system, the system doesn’t remove them entirely, it actually
moves deleted items to a special holding folder called <b>Trash</b>.
So, for example, let’s say you accidentally deleted your Adapt It
Unicode Work folder in a previous work session, but you didn’t
notice that it had been deleted until now. As soon as you notice your
mistake, you should <b>select the Trash folder</b> in the File
Manager’s Sidebar as shown in the illustration below:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Nemo-Trash-selected-showing-deleted-Adapt-It-Unicode-Work-folder.png" name="Image14" align="left" width="586" height="264">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">If you see the deleted
item in the Trash holding folder, there is a good chance you can
restore it to its original location if you need to. Select the
deleted item to highlight it – in this case we click on the <b>Adapt
It Unicode Work</b> folder to <b>highlight it</b>:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Nemo-Trash-selected-showing-deleted-Adapt-It-Unicode-Work-folder-selected.png" name="Image15" align="left" width="527" height="236">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Then, with the item
highlighted, click on the <b>Restore Selected Items</b> button at the
top of the Trash folder’s contents window as shown above. The
trashed item will disappear from the Trash holding folder, and be
restored to its original location. You should verify that it has been
restored by navigating back to the Home folder. The Adapt It Unicode
Work folder should now be restored to its original location in the
Home folder.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Note: You will notice that
there is also an <b>Empty Trash</b> button at the top of the contents
window when looking at the special Trash folder. If the Wasta system
gives you a notice that you are getting low on disk storage space, or
you would like to remove all items permanently from the Trash folder,
you can click the <b>Empty Trash</b> button. Be cautious, however,
because after you press the <b>Empty Trash</b> button, all deleted
items will be gone forever.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<h4 class="western">If you accidentally Move a file or folder</h4>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The restoration process is
similar if you accidentally move a folder from one place to another
place. <b>This can happen if you are not careful doing a double-click
while attempting to open the folder</b>. For example, if you
accidentally <b>moved</b> a file or folder, you can click on <b>Undo
Move</b> on the <b>Edit</b> menu:</p>

<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">If you have made any
change to Adapt It's or Paratext's folders and cannot Undo those
changes, you should &quot;Restore&quot; the folder you changed using
the Wasta-Backup program's Restore function.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="Different Views of File Manager's Data"></a>
Different Views of File Manager's Data</h3>
<p>To the right of File Manager’s Navigation bar is a <b>View-Search
bar</b> that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-View-Search-icon-bar.png" name="Image63" align="left" width="201" height="53">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Each of the icons in the <b>View-Search bar</b> have a purpose
which we will discuss and illustrate below.</p>
<p>The last three icons we will discuss first. They control how File
Manager presents files and folders in its content window – your
“view” of the data in the content window. 
</p>
<h4 class="western"><a name="Icon View"></a>Icon View</h4>
<p>The default view is the <b>Icon View</b> which is highlighted in
light blue color in the illustration of the View-Search bar above,
and the view you’ve seen in the screen shot illustrations in this
document. File Manager will keep using the Icon View unless you
change the Default View to one of the other two views in File
Manager’s Preferences (see Appendix). You can temporarily change
the view to List View or Compact View by clicking on one of the later
two icons shown in the View-Search bar image above. The Icon View the
largest icons (and thumbnail images of photo files), but it does not
show any information about the size, type, or date modified
information. The <b>Icon View</b> of the Work Reports folder’s
contents looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-View-Search-icon-bar-Icon-View-icon-sample.png" name="Image69" align="left" width="665" height="344">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h4 class="western"><a name="List View"></a>List View</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The List View is the view that shows
the most detailed information about the individual folders and files
shown in the contents window – including the Name, Size (number of
items in a folder; size of a file), Type, Date Modified, and the
ability to display the “parent-child” relationships. The <b>List
View</b> of the Work Reports folder’s contents looks like this:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-View-Search-icon-bar-List-View-icon-sample.png" name="Image70" align="left" width="671" height="321">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Wasta Linux users who have used since
version Wasta 12.04, may be accustomed to seeing the <span style="font-weight: normal">List
View</span> within the File Manager, since List View was the default
view in some earlier versions of Wasta. Some regional customizations
of Wasta Linux may also have set the default view for File Manager to
be the List View. For these reasons this documentation will cover
some of the extra features of List View in more detail here within
the discussion of the List View.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">First, you need to know how you can
change the default view for the contents window in File Manager.</p>
<h5 class="western">How to make List View the default view in File
Manager</h5>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The default view in File Manager is
determined by a setting in the <b>Preferences</b> dialog. To access
the Preferences dialog click on File Manager’s <b>Edit</b> menu and
select <b>Preferences</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> as shown
below:</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Edit-Preferences-menu.png" name="Image75" align="left" width="311" height="351">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The Preferences dialog appears which
looks like this:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Edit-Preferences-dialog-Views-tab.png" name="Image76" align="left" width="526" height="412">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">As you can see from the illustration
above, the Preferences dialog actually has a number of other settings
that can be changed. There are six “tabs” of information listed
along the top of the Preferences dialog: Views, Behavior, Display,
List Columns, Preview, and Toolbar. Each of those tabs has a page of
options that can be changed – according to your preferences.
Changing the Default View from Icon View to List View is the only
preference option that we will cover in this documentation. You might
like to make some other preference changes – especially after you
have developed some skill in using the File Manager.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">To change the Default View, <b>c</b><b>lick
on the drop down arrow of the ‘View new folders using’</b> list
box, and select the <b>List View</b> option as shown below:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Edit-Preferences-dialog-Views-tab-List-View-option-selected.png" name="Image77" align="left" width="546" height="145">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Then click on <b>Close</b> at the
bottom right of the Preferences dialog. <b>The change is not made
immediately, but will happen the next time that you run the File
Manager. </b>It will use the <b>List View</b> as its new default view
from this time onward – unless, of course, you later change the
default view back to Icon View or Compact View - using this same
Preferences dialog. Below we illustrate some of the features of the
List View.</p>
<h5 class="western">Listing a folder's contents (without opening the
folder)</h5>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">In List View, each folder
that has some kind of content (at least one file of some kind, or a
child folder) will have a <b>little right-pointing wedge</b> showing
next to the folder’s name as shown below:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Initial-Home-View-in-List-View.png" name="Image78" align="left" width="656" height="340">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The illustration above
shows the Home folder in List View. Note that the Documents folder,
the Downloads folder, and the Pictures folder have <b>a little </b><b>gray
r</b><b>ight-pointing wedge</b> on the left side of the Documents
icon. Enlarged, the wedge beside the Documents folder looks like
this:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-List-View-wedge-with-folder-closed.png" name="Image79" align="left" width="340" height="57">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
You
can list the contents of a folder by clicking on the little
right-pointing wedge that is shown next to the folder name. This
lists the contents of the folder below the folder and indented a
little to the right – without making the contents of the folder
occupy the entire contents window. This can help you see the big
picture of your folder’s parent-child relationships. Here is a
simple illustration of what our Home folder looks like with the
wedges activated so that the contents of the Documents folder is
listed below it, and the contents of the Work Reports folder is
listed below it – without losing the overall view of the folder’s
parent-child relationships:</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">In the illustration above,
the <b>Documents</b> folder’s wedge was clicked/opened to reveal
that it has a child folder called <b>Work Reports</b>. The <b>Work
Reports</b> folder’s wedge was also clicked/opened to reveal that
is has <b>6 child folders named 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and
2018</b>. Each of these 6 year folders also have some content (the
Size column indicates the first 5 have 12 items, and the 2018 folder
has just 1 item). If we clicked on the wedge next to the 2018 folder
we would see that the item it contains is a Writer document called
“January 2018 Work Report.odt” as shown in the partial contents
window shot below:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Initial-Home-View-in-List-View-Documents-Work-Reports-2018-wedges-opened.png" name="Image81" align="left" width="412" height="69">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The List View shows shows
helpful information for files. In the shot above we see that the
<b>January 2018 Work Report.odt</b> document is 9.6kB in size, and it
was created or last modified on 2017-10-05. It is a template document
that is now ready to fill in when I am ready to complete my work
report at the end of January 2018. When I have filled in the details
of my work for that month, and Save my edits of the file at the end
of January 2018, the size will get much larger and date modified will
show the logical date the report was completed.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Note that the little
gray wedges act like toggles</b><b> – opening and closing the
folder’s contents list</b>. When the wedge is pointing to the
<b>right</b>, the folder beside it is “<b>closed</b>” and its
contents are not listed in the List View. One click on the wedge
toggles it to an “<b>open</b>” state and the wedge points <b>down</b>
– at the list of items the folder contains. A second click on a
downward pointing wedge, and it toggles it back to its “closed”
state and the folder’s contents again disappears from the List
View. If a folder is actually empty, toggling the wedge (if it has a
wedge) will show “(Empty)” under the folder.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">With time you may create
many folders within other folders, and with some care, you can keep
your files and folders organized in a way that makes sense to you.
The List View can help you “see the big picture” as you add more
and more parent-child folders in organizing your data.</p>
<h5 class="western">Information Column Headings and Sort Orders in
List View</h5>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">When the File Manager is set to &quot;List
View&quot; (see above), the top of the main window displays this bar
that is divided into 4 column headings: Name, Size, Type, and Date
Modified. The header bar looks like this:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-List-View-column-headings-Default-Name-sort.png" name="Image73" align="left" width="665" height="28">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>The headers you see in the image
above only appear in the &quot;List View&quot;</b>. This view
displays some helpful information about the folders and files that
are listed under the headings. There are 4 default headers in List
View: <b>Name</b>, <b>Size</b>, <b>Type</b> and <b>Date Modified</b>.
These are the default headers. (which headers are shown in List View
can be set in the List Columns tab of the Preferences dialog accessed
from the File Manager’s Edit menu). Each of the headers can be used
to sort the order of the items that appear in List View, as described
below. 
</p>
<h5 class="western">Sort orders in List View</h5>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-weight: normal">In
the illustration above, t</span><span style="font-weight: normal">he
down arrow at the right end of the </span><b>Name</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
column heading, indicates </span><span style="font-weight: normal">that
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">the sort order of the listed
items is determined by the </span><span style="font-weight: normal">item’s</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
</span><b>Name</b><span style="font-weight: normal">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">The
</span><b>direction the </b><b>arrow </b><b>is pointing</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">also provides more
information about the sort order. In the illustration </span><span style="font-weight: normal">below</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
the arrow is pointing </span><b>down</b><span style="font-weight: normal">,
indicating that the sort’</span><span style="font-weight: normal">s</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
</span><b>“reading order” goes downward</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
– that is, as you move </span><b>down the list</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
you </span><b>advance through the alphabetical order</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
</span><b>–</b><b> sorted by the item’s Name</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
as shown by the direction of the arrow in the red box below:</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-List-View-column-headings-Name-sort.png" name="Image87" align="left" width="637" height="27">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The sort order in List View will be
changed if you click directly on the header. Each click on a header
will reverse the sort order based on that header. For example, if you
click on the <b>Name</b> header segment of the bar, the folders and
files will be sorted in reverse alphabetical order (bottom of the
alphabet at the top). The direction of the little arrow will then
point up instead of down as shown below:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-List-View-column-headings-Name-sort-inverted.png" name="Image72" align="left" width="635" height="26">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Sorting for a given column works like a
toggle. If you click the <b>Name</b> header segment of the bar
<b>a</b><b>nother</b><b> time</b>, the folders and files will be
sorted back in normal alphabetical order (top of the alphabet at the
top). 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Hint: If you notice that the
contents seem to be sorting strangely you may have accidentally
clicked on one of the headers while attempting to select one of the
top items in the List View. If that happens, just click once or twice
on the header you want items in the list to sort by – watching the
direction of the little arrow that indicates the sort direction. When
the arrow points down the end of the alphabet is downward; when the
arrow points up, the end of the alphabet is upward.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If you click on the <b>Size</b> header
segment of the bar, the folders and files will be sorted according to
their size, from smallest to largest. (the little arrow will appear
next to the Size header and initially point down):</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-List-View-column-headings-Size-sort.png" name="Image74" align="left" width="637" height="28">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">A second click on the Size segment will
sort the folders and files from largest to smallest (with the arrow
pointing up):</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-List-View-column-headings-Size-sort-inverted.png" name="Image82" align="left" width="635" height="30">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If you want to return to viewing the
files sorted by Name rather than Size just click on the Name segment
of the header bar.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If you click on the <b>Type</b> header
segment of the bar, the folders and files will be sorted according to
their type - sorting them alphabetically by their extension (the
little arrow will appear next to the Type header and initially point
down):</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-List-View-column-headings-Type-sort.png" name="Image83" align="left" width="637" height="28">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">A second click on the Type header
segment will reverse the order - but still using the extension to
sort by rather than the name (with the arrow pointing up):</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-List-View-column-headings-Type-sort-inverted.png" name="Image84" align="left" width="637" height="28">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If you want to view the files sorted by
Name rather than by Type just click on the Name segment of the header
bar.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, if you click on the <b>Date
Modified</b> segment of the bar, the folders and files will be sorted
according to the date they were last modified - from newest to oldest
(the little arrow will appear next to the Date Modified and initially
pointing down):</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-List-View-column-headings-Date-Modified-sort.png" name="Image85" align="left" width="637" height="27">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">A second click on the Date Modified
header segment will reverse the order - from oldest to newest (with
the arrow pointing up):</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-List-View-column-headings-Date-Modified-sort-inverted.png" name="Image86" align="left" width="637" height="27">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Each additional click on Date Modified
reverses the sort order by dates. If you want to view the files
sorted by Name rather than by Date Modified just click on the Name
segment of the header bar.</p>
<h4 class="western">Compact View</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The Compact View is the view that can
show the most files and folders at once. It uses multiple columns to
display its information. This view uses smaller icons that Icon View,
but otherwise it shows the same amount of information as the Icon
View. The Compact View of the Work Reports folder’s contents looks
like this:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-View-Search-icon-bar-Compact-View-icon-sample.png" name="Image71" align="left" width="583" height="280">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The Compact View can be helpful when
viewing a folder with many files or folders visible at the same time
in the contents window. (In the above illustration I temporarily
added 12 additional year folders to show how they sort and flow into
columns in the Compact View.) However, you probably would only want
to use it temporarily, and then switch back to a more informative
view.</p>
<h4 class="western">Path toggle button – to show the Linux file
system path/location</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The first button in the View-Search bar
looks like this:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-View-Search-icon-bar-path-toggle-icon.png" name="Image88" align="left" width="47" height="51">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">This button acts as a toggle button. If
we have the <b>Work Reports</b> folder open in the File Manager the
<b>path</b> in the Navigation bar normally would look something like
this:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Navigation-bar-showing-path-to-Work-Reports.png" name="Image89" align="left" width="529" height="44">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">By clicking on the <b>Path toggle
button</b> in the View-Search bar, the named path shown in the red
box in the image above changes to show its actual path in the Linux
file system, as shown in the illustration below:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Navigation-bar-showing-toggled-Linux-path-to-Work-Reports.png" name="Image90" align="left" width="657" height="41">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">This view can be helpful for Wasta
users who are familiar and comfortable working directly with the
Linux file system. Clicking on the button again will toggle the path
back to its normal form.</p>
<h4 class="western">Search documents and folders by name button</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The second button in the View-Search
bar looks like this:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-View-Search-icon-bar-search-toggle-icon.png" name="Image91" align="left" width="47" height="51">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">This Search button can be very handy,
especially when you have many folders and files on your system. <b>It
is helpful to switch to List View before using this Search button.</b>
When you click on this button, File Manager opens a <b>Search bar</b>
as shown (in the red box) below:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-View-Search-icon-bar-Search-button-initial-view.png" name="Image92" align="left" width="665" height="336">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In the illustration above, File Manager
has opened the Work Reports folder and is displaying the contents of
the Work Reports folder. Our view has been switched to List View. We
see that the Work Reports folder has 6 child folders (and since we
are in List View) we can easily see that those 6 folders contain some
items within them. They all have wedges to the left of their folder
names, and the Size column tells us that there are items within each
of the year folders. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, lets say I would like to search
for reports that have the word <b>January</b> in their document
names. With the Search bar’s box open, I type the word <b>January</b>
into that box. Immediately, File Manager starts searching as I type.
It finds that there is a document with January in its name in each of
the year-named folders. Here is the search result:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-View-Search-icon-bar-Search-button-January-search-results.png" name="Image93" align="left" width="688" height="295">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The Search operation found 6 Writer
documents each having the word <b>January</b> in their names – one
in each of the 6 year folders. In addition to showing us their <b>Name</b>,
having <b>List View</b> enabled, the search results also show us the
documents’ <b>Size</b>, <b>Type</b>, and most helpful their
<b>Location</b><span style="font-weight: normal">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">If
we wanted to open any of these documents to see the actual reports,
all we need to do is one of the following Opening actions:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Click on their name</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
	and the click on </span><b>File : Open With LibreOffice Writer</b><span style="font-weight: normal">,
	or</span></p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Click on their name</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
	and press the </span><b>Enter</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
	key, or</span></p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Click on their name</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
	and use the </span><b>Ctrl+O</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
	shortcut key command, or</span></p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Double-click on the name</b></p>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Note</b><b>s</b><span style="font-weight: normal">:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-weight: normal">The
	Search bar acts like a filter. It looks through all your files and
	filters out any the don’t meet the search criteria, and just shows
	you the list of files that match the search criteria. For more
	detailed search you can click on the </span><b>Plus</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
	button at the right end of the </span><b>Search bar</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
	to add more search criteria. Click on the </span><b>All Files</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
	button to start a new search.</span></p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">You can use
	the Search function with Icon View selected. It will still find all
	6 of the Writer documents with January in their names. It just won’t
	show you their Size, Type, and Location.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">There are many other settings and
features that are available on the File Manager's menus. The one's
described in this document are the main ones. 
</p>
<h3 class="western">The File Manager Help Menu Topics</h3>
<p>File Manager itself has a list of Help topics. That help system is
extensive, but fairly condensed, is sometimes quite technical, and
doesn’t have many illustrations. This document covers most of what
is covered in the Help topics, but has many more illustrations that
make it easier to follow for Wasta users learning how to make the
best use of the File Manager.</p>
<p>To access File Manager’s built-in Help topics, click on the <b>Help</b>
menu and select <b>All Topics</b> or simply press the <b>F1</b> key
as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="wasta-docs-images/Files-Nemo-Help-All-Topics-F1.png" name="Image101" align="left" width="665" height="142" border="0"/>

<h3 class="western">The actual name of the File Manager</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Many Linux software programs have
special names that the people who created the program have given to
those programs. The special name of the File Manager we have
described in this document is <b>N</b><b>emo</b>. There are actually
a number of different File Managers that are available for Linux
computers. We are using the one called <b>Nemo</b> on our Wasta Linux
computers. You can usually find the special name of nearly all Linux
programs by running the program (usually from a menu or launcher) and
then clicking on the program's Help menu, and selecting the <b>About
...</b> item on that menu. If we click on our File Manager's Help
menu and select <b>About</b> a message window (or dialog) appears
that looks like this:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">This <b>About</b> dialog tells us some
information about the Nemo program. It gives us the current version
of the program (3.0.6), a short description of what the program does,
and a <b>License</b> button that will display the open source license
that ensures that Nemo remains a free program which can be freely
distributed, and a <b>Close</b> button.</p>
