Note: The illustrations, screenshots and graphics for the document files above are
   contained in the wasta-docs-images folder. This folder must be present for
   the images and screenshots to appear within the LibreOffice Writer (odt) and
   the Browser (.html) documents - since all images are linked to the images
   within the wasta-docs-images folder, rather than being embedded in the odt 
   and html documents. The pdf documents, however, do have the images embedded
   within them.
